"October 9, 2023",LyondellBasell Nears 2030 Renewables Goal with Lightsource bp Solar Deal,"Plastics, chemicals, and refining company LyondellBasell announced a 10-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with solar developer Lightsource bp for the delivery of approximately 284,000 MWh of renewable electricity annually in Spain.
Under the new agreement, LyondellBasell will secure 149 MW of capacity from Lightsource bp’s solar project in Spain, beginning in 2026, with the energy delivered roughly equal to the annual electricity consumption of approximately 78,000 European homes.
According to LyondellBasell, the agreement will bring the company to reach 78% of its goal to procure at least 50% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030. The target was first announced in 2021, together with other climate commitments, including goals to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% by 2030, and reach net zero emissions across its global operations by 2050. In December 2022, the company raised its Scope 1 and 2 target to a 42% reduction by 2030, and introduced a goal to reduce Scope 3 emissions by 30% by 2030.
Chris Cain, LyondellBasell Senior Vice President for Net Zero Transition Strategy, said:
“We are taking decisive steps to reduce our absolute scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, while creating solutions for everyday sustainable living. Solar power purchase agreements accelerate the development of clean energy and are a critical lever in our emissions reduction efforts.”
Lightsource bp is a joint venture between energy company bp and Lightsource bp management. The company has developed 8.4 GW of solar power to date, and the new agreement marks the company’s first cross border corporate PPA signed in Spain.
Zosia Riesner, Director of Power Markets for Europe at Lightsource bp, said:
“We are delighted to have been selected by LyondellBasell as a partner on their greenhouse gas emission reduction journey. We take immense pride in our ability to offer tailored and customized solutions to our customers while leveraging Lightsource bp’s global reach to offer additionality and innovative structures through our contracts. Our continued investment in growing our pipeline of projects across Spain provides exciting opportunities for collaborations like this in the near future.”",COMPANIES/ ENERGY TRANSITION,ESGTODAY
"October 9, 2023","EU Adopts Laws to Double Renewable Energy Share, Decarbonize Aviation","The European Council today announced the adoption of two pieces of legislation today, including a directive to nearly double the share of renewable energy consumption in the EU by 2030, and a law aimed at decarbonizing the aviation sector by accelerating the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).
The Council’s adoption of the new rules marks the last major step in the completion of two of the final pieces of the European Commission’s “Fit for 55” roadmap – the EU’s proposed strategy to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.
Following the EU Council’s announcements, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said:
“The European Green Deal is delivering the change we need to reduce CO² emissions. It does so while keeping the interests of our citizens in mind, and providing opportunities for our European industry. The legislation to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 is now in place, and I am very happy that we are even on track to overshoot this ambition.”
One of the key pieces of legislation adopted by Council included the Renewables Energy Directive, which mandates that renewable energy make up 42.5% of the EU’s overall energy consumption by 2030, while also directing EU Member States to endeavor to collectively achieve an indicative renewable energy target of 45%. Renewable energy accounted for approximately 22% of the EU energy mix in 2021.
The legislation significantly raises the EU’s renewable energy goal from its current 2030 target of 32%, and even above the initial 40% goal proposed by the European Commission’s “Fit for 55” roadmap, the EU’s proposed strategy to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. That target was raised to the 45% goal in May 2022 with the EU’s REPowerEU Plan, as part of the strategy to rapidly reduce reliance on Russian fossil fuels in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The Renewable Energy Directive also includes a series of sector-specific sub-targets aimed at accelerating the adoption of renewables in industries in which adoption has been slower, including transport, industry, buildings and district heating and cooling. Sector targets under the legislation include reaching at least a 49% renewable energy share in buildings by 2030, as well as measures to gradually increase renewable targets for cooling and heating, a 14.5% reduction in transport sector emissions by 2030 through increased renewables deployment, requirements for industry to increase the use of renewable energy annually by 1.6% and for 42% of the hydrogen used in industry to come from renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs) by 2030, and 60% by 2035.
Teresa Ribera, Spanish acting Minister for the Ecological Transition, said:
“This is a great achievement in the framework of the ´Fit for 55´package which will help reaching the EU’s climate goal of reducing EU emissions by at least 55% by 2030. It is a step forward which will contribute to reach the EU´s climate targets in a fair, cost-effective and competitive way.”
The Council also adopted the “ReFuelEU aviation” law, aimed at increasing both the demand and supply of sustainable aviation fuel, with rules including minimum blends of SAF for fuel suppliers, as well as requirements for aircraft operators and airports.
Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels. Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, however, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels.
For aviation fuel suppliers, the new rules will require a minimum share of SAF at EU airports, starting a 2% in 2025, and increasing over time to reach 70% by 2050, as well as a minimum share of synthetic fuels starting in 2030 and also increasing through 2050.
Rules for aircraft operators include a requirement for flights departing EU airports to refuel only with the fuel necessary for the flight, and to ensure that the yearly amount of aviation fuel uplifted at EU airports is equal to at least 90% of the yearly aviation fuel required. According to the European Council, the rules are aimed at avoiding emissions related to extra weight from unnecessary fuel, and to avoid carbon leakage through “tankering,” in which airlines would deliberately carry excess fuel to avoid refueling at airports with higher SAF requirements.
The new law also requires the creation of a labelling scheme about aircraft operators’ environmental performance using SAF, aimed at enabling consumers to make informed choices and at promoting greener flights. Several airlines have been accused or charged with greenwashing over unclear or misleading SAF-related claims over the past few months.
Raquel Sánchez Jiménez, Spanish acting minister of transport, mobility and urban agenda, said:
“The new law will provide legal certainty to aircraft operators and fuel suppliers in Europe. By kick-starting the large-scale production of sustainable aviation fuels, it will soon make the EU’s aviation sector much greener. This is a key step in our broader effort to reach our climate targets at European and global level.”
With the Council’s adoption, the new laws will now be published in the EU’s Official Journal for subsequent entry into force.
Von der Leyen added:
“This is an important sign to Europe and to our global partners that the green transition is possible, that Europe is delivering on its promises.”",ENERGY TRANSITION/ ENVIRONMENT/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY
"October 9, 2023","California Governor Signs Climate Disclosure Bills, but Pushes Back on Timeline and Cost","California Governor Gavin Newsom signed two new landmark climate-related disclosure bills on Saturday, which will require large companies to disclose their value chain emissions and report on climate-related financial risks, but has signaled that the bills’ timelines will be pushed out and cost impacts on businesses addressed before the new laws are implemented.
Both bills, SB 253, the “Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act” and SB 261, “Greenhouse gases: climate-related financial risk,” passed in the California Assembly in September. Newsom announced a week later that he intended to sign the bills into law, but that some “modest cleanup on some little language” would be required.
SB 253 requires companies with revenues greater than $1 billion that do business in California to report annually on their emissions from all scopes, including direct emissions (Scope 1), emissions from purchase and use of electricity (Scope 2), and indirect emissions, including those associated with supply chains, business travel, employee commuting, procurement, waste, and water usage (Scope 3).
As passed in the Assembly, SB 253’s disclosure obligations would begin in 2026 for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and in 2027 for Scope 3 emissions, with measurement and reporting to be performed according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol standards. The law would also require companies to obtain third party assurance for their emissions reporting, starting with a limited assurance level beginning in 2026 for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and at a more stringent reasonable assurance level in 2030, and at a limited assurance level for Scope 3 in 2030.
In a statement released by Newsom announcing the signing of the bill, the governor warned that SB 253’s implementation deadlines “are likely infeasible,” and also expressed concern that the new rules’ reporting protocol “could result in inconsistent reporting across businesses.” Newsom said that his administration would work with the authors of the bill to address these issues.
Newsom added that he was “concerned about the overall financial impact of this bill on businesses,” and instructed the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the agency directed by the bill to develop and adopt the reporting regulations, to “monitor the cost impact as it implements this new bill and to make recommendations to streamline the program.”
Newsom’s statement follows recent comments by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler in his testimony to the House Financial Services Committee that the Commission, which has released plans for their own climate-related disclosure rules for public companies, has received comments from companies and investors concerned about the requirements to report on Scope 3 emissions, particularly on the impact on smaller businesses that would be required to track and report on their emissions, even if not technically covered by the rules, as well as on the early stage of development and current unreliability of Scope 3 reporting.
SB 261 applies to U.S. companies that do business in California and with revenues greater that $500 million to prepare a report disclosing their climate-related financial risk, in accordance with the TCFD framework, as well as measures to reduce and adapt to that risk. Prior to approval in the Assembly, the bill was amended to move the date of first disclosures to 2026 from 2024, and to require reporting every two years instead of annually.
In his statement on signing SB 261, however, Newsom warned that the implementation deadline would not provide CARB “with sufficient time to adequately carry out the requirements” of the bill. Newsom also again warned about the cost impact of the bill on businesses, and directed CARB to monitor the costs and make streamlining recommendations for this law as well.",ESG REPORTING/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY
"October 6, 2023",EU Lawmakers Agree on Rules Eliminating 500 Million Tonnes of GHG Emissions,"Lawmakers in the European Parliament and Council announced that they have reached a provisional agreement on new legislation that will result in a massive reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fluorinated gases (F-gases) and ozone-depleting substances (ODS).
According to a statement by the European Commission welcoming the agreement, the proposed legislation would prevent nearly 500 million tonnes of GHG emissions by 2050, and contribute to European climate goals to achieve a 55% emissions reduction by 2030, and reach climate neutrality by 2050.
Fluorinated gases and ODSs are used in a range of industrial applications, and are found in appliances including refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump equipment. The substances are highly potent greenhouse gases, with global warming potential thousands, or even tens of thousands of times of stronger than CO2.
According to the EU Commission, the proposed new rules come as demand for equipment using the gases is rising rapidly, driven by increasing temperatures and higher living standards.
The new rules would see consumption hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which account for around 90% of F-gas emissions, completely phased out by 2050, and reduced by 95% by 2030, on a 2015 basis. The agreement also includes a ban on placing several categories of products and equipment containing HFCs, such as certain domestic refrigerators, chillers, foams and aerosols on the market, with restrictions allowing F-gases to be used in new equipment only if no suitable alternatives are available or only if the most climate-friendly F-gases are used. The rules also an export ban to ensure that obsolete equipment containing high global warming potential gases are not exported to countries outside the EU, as well as providing incentives for the use of climate-friendly alternatives.
Following the provisional agreement, the new rules will be forwarded to the Council and Parliament’s environment committee for endorsement, and then for formal adoption by each institution.
Maroš Šefčovič, Executive Vice-President for European Green deal, Interinstitutional Relations and Foresight, said:
“This is excellent news for Europe and for the world. With F-gases used for air conditioning and refrigeration and demand in this area projected to grow, it is essential that we make sure these technologies do not exacerbate global warming and that climate-friendly alternatives are incentivised.”",ENVIRONMENT/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY
"October 6, 2023",EU Parliament Adopts European Green Bond Standard,"Lawmakers in the European Parliament voted 418-79 on Thursday to approve the adoption of a new European Green Bond (EuGB) label, aimed at fighting greenwashing and providing investors with confidence that their investments are being appropriately directed towards financing sustainable business activities and technologies.
Under the new standard, companies issuing bonds under the voluntary EuGB designation will be required to follow a strict set of investment and transparency criteria, including disclosures on how the proceeds from the bonds will be used, as well as committing to a green transition plan, and reporting on how the investments contribute to the those plans.
Green bond issuance volumes have surged over the past several years as companies and governments have increasingly used them to finance their environmental sustainability and transition initiatives. Despite slower volumes last year amidst a broader issuance market pullback, issuances have rebounded, reaching record volumes in the first half of this year, with particular strength in the European market, which accounted for nearly 60% of the global market, according to Moody’s Investors Service.
The European Commission launched its EuGB regulation proposal in July 2021, aimed at establishing a “gold standard” for green bonds, and forming part of a series of initiatives designed to promote a more sustainable financial system and help facilitate the necessary investments to advance the EU’s and global climate goals.
In May 2022, the EU Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee unveiled a series of amendments to significantly widen the scope of the new regulations, with rules covering the entire green bond market. The proposals met resistance from industry groups, including the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA), which warned that the stricter regulations could push issuers to turn to other markets and other sources of finance resulting in market contraction and loss of EU sustainable bond leadership, and fragmentation of the international green bond market with the EU following different rules from an international market.
The rules adopted Thursday followed an agreement in March 2023 between the EU Parliament and Council, establishing the EuGB standard as voluntary, while also including a voluntary framework for sustainability-linked bonds and green bonds not issued with the EuGB designation. The agreed text also confirmed that while all proceeds under the new designation will need to be invested in economic activities that are aligned with the EU Taxonomy, it added flexibility enabling 15% to be invested in economic activities that comply with the taxonomy requirements , but in sectors that don’t yet have established taxonomy criteria, with issuers clearly explaining where these funds will be allocated.
In addition to the requirements for issuers, the rules adopted by Parliament set out rules to regulate external reviewers of green bonds, including the establishment of a registration system and supervisory framework, and requiring external reviewers to identify, address and disclose potential conflicts of interest.
European Parliament rapporteur on the green bond rules Paul Tang said:
“Today’s vote is the starting shot for business to get serious about their green bond issuances. Investors are eager to invest in European Green Bonds and from today onwards business can start developing them. This way European Green Bonds can boost Europe’s transition to a sustainable economy.”",GOVERNMENT/ SUSTAINABLE FINANCE,ESGTODAY

"October 5, 2023","Infosys, Economist Impact Launch Platform to Track and Address Scope 3 Emissions","Technology, digital services, and consulting companyInfosys and Economist Group division Economist Impact, announced today the launch of the Value Chain Navigator (VCN), a new platformaimed at helping businesses understand and reduce their scope 3 value chain emissions.                      
Scope 3 includes all indirect emissions that occur in the upstream and downstream activities of an organization’s value chain. These can include emissions from purchased goods and services, business travel, employee commuting, waste disposal, use of sold products, transportation, distribution, investments and leased assets and franchises. Up to 95% of a business’s carbon footprint consists of scope 3 emissions, but only a quarter of businesses account for them in their net zero plans. In fact, according to a global VCN survey of 1,250 businesses, only 53% of companies are currently collecting and monitoring their scope 3 emissions data.
The new platform comes as companies globally face increasing regulatory pressure to report on their scope 3 emissions, with emerging sustainability reporting standards including the EU’s CSRD and the IFRS’ ISSB standards requiring scope 3 disclosure. Scope 3 emissions are typically the most challenging to track and report as they occur in areas outside of the companies’ direct control.
The VCN is an open digital platform that helps businesses understand the complex nature of their scope 3 emissions through interactive tracking, tools and tailored recommendations. The tool will be featured on The Sustainability Project, a content and community platform created by Economist Impact and built by Infosys to advance sustainable solutions and drive impact through a new business-to-business model.
Ashiss Kumar Dash, EVP & Global Head – Services, Utilities, Resources and Energy, Infosys, said:
“The Value Chain Navigator will be pivotal in driving collaborative action at scale to tackle scope 3 emissions, supporting businesses along their value chains to reduce their carbon footprint. With this solution, we further strengthen the tools delivered through The Sustainability Project to empower stakeholders to navigate a changing landscape through data and insights and chart their course for a better future.”
Key features of the new VCN platform include capabilities to explore scope 3 emissions across Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi)-defined business activity levers such as supplier engagement, product design and investment strategy; discover how companies worldwide are addressing scope 3 emissions through the 1,250 company global survey, segmented by region, sector and business size; receive personalized recommendations to reduce scope 3 emissions utilizing a self assessment tool covering specific business challenges and opportunities; and track media coverage of scope 3 innovation and regulation. The tool also includes a spotlight film series of business leaders discussing their challenges and decisions on their own scope 3 journeys.
Claudia Malley, President of Economist Impact, said:
“At Economist Impact we focus on addressing pressing issues and providing the necessary insights to advance sustainable solutions. Our work with Infosys to create The Sustainability Project and now, the Value Chain Navigator, exemplifies the impact we can make in the world.”","ENVIRONMENT/ ESG TOOLS, SERVICES",ESGTODAY
"October 5, 2023","Guest Post: The Bonds Between E, S and G are Stronger and More Important Than Ever Before","By: John McCalla-Leacy, Head of Global ESG at KPMG
The world is in flux. The climate crisis is now daily news and we’re witnesses to the damage inaction can cause to our planet. For business leaders, there is a growing in-tray – of risks and daily challenges. Geopolitical and economic uncertainties are impacting the ability of businesses to function and focus on growth and companies response to the climate crisis has become a political hot-potato. With that in mind, it’s understandable that environmental, social and governance topics are at risk of slipping down the priority list in board rooms.
As KPMG’s Head of Global ESG, it’ll come as no surprise to you to hear me talk of the urgency of ESG. The reality – backed by a substantial body of evidence – is that it does matter and can’t be ignored. Political leaders will make bold commitments, and corporate spokespeople will match the rhetoric with stretching targets and figures that aim to go some way toward ‘dealing’ with ESG, but we all must accelerate the current pace of change, if we are to minimise the impact on the environment.
KPMG’s CEO Outlook is an annual snapshot of business sentiment. We spoke to more than 1,300 CEOs at some of the world’s biggest companies and across a multitude of sectors and countries. Among the topics – ESG. If we compare our 2023 findings with last year, there is some evidence that leaders are ‘softening’ their approach to ESG, but it’s heartening that, in an economically challenging and politically polarized environment, across most areas of environment, social and governance, CEOs remain steadfast in their commitment to drive positive change.
I’m based in the UK, where the Prime Minister has announced plans for a number of delays on environmental targets, including the planned phase out of diesel and unleaded cars, to ‘ease the burden’ on the public. Despite the potential shift in gear, leaders have continued to emphasize that the country will remain focused on meeting its global climate targets. This example shines a light on similar challenges facing business leaders – attempting to respond appropriately to different viewpoints while remaining true to the vision of genuinely tackling the climate crisis.
In our CEO Outlook survey, just over a third of senior executives revealed that the language they use internally and externally to refer to ESG has changed. While it’s down slightly from last year, it reveals the pressures leaders are facing to tackle a growing politicization of the topic. More positively, CEOs are recognizing that shifting political landscapes leave a gap that companies should be filling. 64 percent of leaders told us they understand CEOs have a role to play filling the void of societal changes that can be created during times of political unease – broadly in-line with last year’s findings.
I’ve spoken extensively about the unbreakable links between the E, S and G. Put simply, you can’t tackle issues like governance and societal inequalities without acknowledging challenges like the climate crisis and sustainability.
For CEOs, E, S, and G matters. We’re witnessing a wave of new regulation – across all countries and wider regions. Politicians, the public and investors are taking an increasingly critical view of the positive and negative impact companies can have on the world and they expect us to demonstrate transparency and genuine commitment to be the change makers.
Almost three quarters of CEOs in this year’s survey acknowledged that their current ESG progress isn’t strong enough to withstand the potential scrutiny of stakeholders or shareholders. Again, that figure is broadly in-line with 2022’s findings. To some, it might seem like a disappointing statistic. For me, it’s reassuring. CEOs know that they can do more and are prepared to state that their companies can and must act now. Business leaders should be challenging their own, investment decisions, business model and operations while listening to their customers and employees. Only then can they ensure that their organisation is fit to take advantage of the opportunities this net zero transition creates while remaining resilient to its challenges. I remain optimistic, that regardless of rhetoric, business leaders recognise their role in ensuring they deliver sustainable economic growth that benefits everyone and respects and nurtures our delicate planet. The time is now for us all to act.

"October 5, 2023",Asset Owners Continuing to Increase Allocations to ESG Investments Despite Growing Challenges: Morningstar,"Asset owners are increasing allocations into strategies that integrate ESG factors, despite reporting growing regulatory and data quality barriers to ESG implementation, according to a new survey released by investment research firm Morningstar.
For the report, “Voice of the Asset Owner Survey 2023,” Morningstar surveyed 500 asset owners, including pension funds, insurance general accounts, family offices and outsourced CIOs in countries across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, with combined assets of more than $10.7 trillion.
The survey found that all asset owners are allocating at least a portion of their assets to strategies that take ESG factors into account, and that the proportion that have at least half of their assets in such strategies has increased to 34% from 30% since the 2022 survey. By region, 46% of asset under management are now allocated to strategies that apply ESG considerations, compared to 41% in APAC and only 36% in North America.
The increase in ESG allocation reflects the growth in perceived importance of ESG factors by asset managers. According to the survey, 67% of asset owners reported that ESG has become more material over the past five years, and 52% said that environmental factors in particular have become more material over the past year alone. Similarly, more than half of asset managers said that environmental and social factors including net zero emissions (52%) and diversity and inclusion (57%) are material to investment decisions.
Asset owners’ increasing allocation to ESG strategies, however, also comes as they report growing barriers to ESG implementation. Following a period of strong performance in the carbon intensive energy and utilities sectors, the top challenge to pursuing an ESG investment strategy, reported by 38% of asset owners in 2023 was the impact on returns, up slightly over last year’s survey. Data-related challenges have grown significantly, according to the survey, with 30% of asset owners reporting a lack of standardized data as a barrier to an ESG investment strategy, and 29% citing unreliable or out-of-date data, compared to 15% who reported each of these issues as a challenge in the prior year.
Regulatory factors also saw a significant increase as a challenge to ESG investing, with around 30% of asset managers reporting regulation as a barrier, up ten percentage points over the past year. Fewer than half of asset owners (49%) reported that they find ESG regulations helpful, down significantly from 60% in 2022, while 28% say that regulations serve as a hindrance, up from 25%. Among those reporting regulation as a hindrance, a lack of clarity emerged as the top pain point, with 42% responding that ESG regulations are confusing or unclear, up from 29% last year.
Thomas Kuh, Head of ESG Strategy at Morningstar Indexes, said:
“The second Morningstar Voice of the Asset Owner survey confirms that institutional investors remain highly committed to integrating ESG factors into their global investments, but challenges related to lack of regulatory clarity and the need for better data and resources continue to persist.”
The report also examined asset managers’ usage of resources for managing and measuring ESG risks and opportunities, such as ESG ratings, indexes, data, and tools. Overall, these products and services appear to have improved recently, with nearly two thirds of asset owners reporting that ESG data (63%), ESG ratings (64%), ESG indexes (65%) and ESG tools (66%) have gotten better over the past five years. When asked which improvements in these solutions would benefit them the most, 48% of asset owners said that more accurate data, followed by 42% who want more timely data.
The survey also found that asset owners expect artificial intelligence to significantly impact ESG investing, with 70% expecting AI adoption to increase for data collection and 67% for ESG analysis.
Arnold Gast, ESG Research Director at Morningstar Sustainalytics, said:
“As stewards of some of the largest pools of global capital, asset owners have stayed anchored to their fiduciary duty despite a range of challenges related to ESG market data, regulatory confusion and market performance. As their job becomes increasingly complex, asset owners continue to raise their expectations of a range of key stakeholders to provide better insight, research, data and tools to address the evolving sustainable investment landscape.”

"October 4, 2023","Oxy, ADNOC Partner on Potential Megaton-Scale Carbon Capture Facility in UAE","Energy giants Occidental and Abu Dhabi-based ADNOC announced a new agreement to launch an engineering study aimed at assessing the feasibility of building a new 1 million tonne-per-year Direct Air Capture (DAC) facility in the UAE.
The facility would be one of the largest DAC projects in the world, as well as the first megaton-scale DAC facility outside the U.S.
The agreement follows an MOU signed between the two companies in August to jointly explore carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) projects in the U.S. and the UAE.
Vicki Hollub, Occidental President and CEO, said:
“This agreement demonstrates how Oxy and ADNOC are committed to advancing direct air capture technology in the UAE and underscores the necessary urgency needed to deliver global-scale climate solutions. We will continue leveraging our carbon management expertise to deliver value, engage committed partners and accelerate our ability to achieve our net-zero targets and help others meet theirs.”
DAC technology, listed by the IEA as a key carbon removal option in the transition to a net-zero energy system, extracts CO2 directly from the atmosphere for use as a raw material or permanently removed when combined with storage. According to the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change mitigation study released last year, scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C include carbon dioxide removal methods scaling to billions of tons of removal annually over the coming decades, with DAC positioned to potentially account for a significant portion of the total.
Most solutions that capture and store CO2 are early stage and currently limited in scale, including DAC. Oxy’s carbon capture-focused subsidiary 1PointFive is currently constructing Stratos in Ector County Texas, which it expects to be the largest DAC facility in the world to date, designed to capture 500,000 tonnes of CO2 per year when fully operational.
Under the new agreement, Oxy and ADNOC will study the feasibility of a new megaton-scale facility that uses the same CO2 extraction technology as the Texas-based project. Stratos uses DAC technology developed by Canada-based Carbon Engineering, which pulls in atmospheric air and extracts the carbon dioxide through a series of chemical reactions, which is then concentrated, purified and compressed for permanent storage or utilization. Oxy announced in August that it has agreed to acquire Carbon Engineering for $1.1 billion.
If the new project is approved, the companies said that CO2 extracted at the new DAC facility is expected to be connected to ADNOC’s CO2 infrastructure for injection and permanent storage into saline reservoirs not used for oil and gas production.
Musabbeh Al Kaabi, Executive Director for Low Carbon Solutions and International Growth at ADNOC said:
“Today’s announcement represents continued positive momentum in our partnership with Occidental to significantly scale up promising carbon management technologies. This joint investment in the proposed first megaton direct air capture facility in the region exemplifies ADNOC’s commitment to leverage partnerships and promising technology to accelerate our decarbonization journey on the way to net zero by 2045.”",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT,ESGTODAY
"October 4, 2023",Hormel Foods Commits to Value Chain Emissions Reduction,"Global branded food company Hormel Foods announced today a series of new climate targets, including a goals to reduceabsolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from its operations 50%, and  within its supply chain 27.5% by 2030, compared to a 2019 base year.
The company said that its GHG reduction targets have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), adding that the goals are aligned with the Paris Agreement ambition to limit average temperature rise to 1.5°C.
Food and beverage sector emissions account for about a third of global GHG emissions and are among the most difficult to address, with the vast majority coming from the supply chains of food and beverage companies, rather than from “direct” emissions from the companies’ operations.
Hormel detailed initiatives it has taken to reduce emissions, including increasing its procurement of domestic renewable electricity from less than 10% to 100% last year through power-purchase agreements that generated over 936 million kWh hours during 2022. For these efforts, the company has received awards from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Center for Resource Solutions.
Tom Raymond, director of environmental sustainability at Hormel Foods said:
“We are proud to announce these ambitious targets to help fight climate change. It is going to require all team members, partners and supply-chain members to reach these goals and continue to decarbonize every part of our value chain.”",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT,ESGTODAY

"October 4, 2023",Energy Analytics Startup Amperon Raises $20 Million,"Amperon Holdings, which uses AI to forecast energy usage and supply for energy markets, raised $20 million in Series B funding, with proceeds to be used to unlock more value from grid data and advance electricity forecasting innovation, enabling businesses to navigate the energy complex and accelerate grid decarbonization.
Founded in 2018, Houston-based Amperon builds AI-powered electricity analytics for energy market participants, enabling informed decision-making, energy utilization optimization, and improved grid sustainability.
According to the company, the investment will enable Amperon to expand from an electricity demand forecasting platform to a comprehensive data analytics solution that can provide grid operators with the data they need to incorporate more intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar into the grid power supply without destabilizing it, as well as to address demand unpredictability caused by the effects of climate change.Climate change, and the extreme weather events it brings, make decarbonization even more essential and demand more unpredictable. More robust energy data analytics can also help decarbonize the grid.
In addition, the data will help grid customers meet the growing pressure to map and shrink their carbon footprints, including their energy usage which falls under Scope 2 emissions.
Amperon’s revenue has grown by 5x since 2021 and the company has quadrupled its staff. The company plans to hire more engineers, data scientists, customer support, and sales roles as the company expands into new markets.
Sean Kelly, CEO and co-founder of Amperon said:

"October 4, 2023",Guest Post: Technology is Unlocking New Opportunities for Sustainability. Will Businesses See Them?,"By: Christina Shim, Global Head of Product Management & Strategy, IBM Sustainability Software
Next month, scientists, political leaders, and business people from around the world will gather in Dubai for the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference. The annual event, billed COP28, will come after the hottest summer in recorded history and some of the most extreme and destructive flood in Europe and North Africa.
The stakes are real. Estimates show that more than 90 percent of businesses have at least one asset financially exposed to climate risks. Climate risks are prompting credit downgrades and raising borrowing costs for cities, countries, and companies. This year, in fact, the U.S. has already set an unfortunate record with 23 separate billion-dollar weather disasters—with months still left to go. It’s clear: the world needs to seize every opportunity it can to move toward sustainability.
The good news is that business appears on board. IBM research shows that 95 percent of organizations have developed operational ESG propositions. CEOs and their executive teams increasingly have compensation tied to sustainability goals. And four out of five CEOs expect sustainability and ESG investments to actually improve business results in the next five years. CEOs know the time to act is now.  
New technologies, often software and IT, are also giving organizations unprecedented capabilities. AI is helping consolidate and analyze massive amounts of data, giving business leaders insights on how to reduce energy costs, minimize waste, and lower emissions. Sensors and software are helping enable predictive maintenance that can significantly extend the life of infrastructure. Technologies are also optimizing how organizations use the Cloud and helping fuel smarter and more sustainable supply chains.
Turning ambition into action
The bad news is that there may be a gap between perception and action. New survey data—collected this August by Morning Consult for IBM’s 2023 Sustainable Business Snapshot—shows that an impressive 93 percent of sustainability and IT decisionmakers think their company is somewhat or very mature in using data to track sustainability progress. Yet only 42 percent of that same group say they are ready to report on Scope 1 emissions—the greenhouse gas emissions directly controlled by an organization.
The report, which polled 3,250 global business leaders from companies with 1,000 or more employees, found that surveyed executives broadly understand that IT investments impact their organization’s sustainability. Nearly two-thirds of organizations have dedicated budgets to apply IT toward sustainability, and 38 percent plan to significantly increase their spend in the next year.
Yet, while the respondents feel mature in tracking sustainability, the metrics that they describe collecting suggest another story. About half track energy consumption. A little less than that track Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Only a third measure supplier metrics. Moreover, 60 percent say that reporting and compliance is challenging. Eighteen percent say additional investment in IT for sustainability is hindered by lack of data or insights on a path forward. Another 18 percent said they have no strategy at all.
Innovating toward a low-carbon future
This week precedes another weekslong event starting in November: the UN Climate Change Conference, or COP28. Since 1995, these meetings have sought to foster collaborative action on climate change, resulting in the famous 1997 Kyoto Protocol and 2015 Paris Agreement.
For businesses that need a strategy on IT and sustainability, those that need more data and insights, and even those who just want to accelerate progress toward their sustainability goals, now is the time to take action—and COP28 will be an opportunity to both find solutions and demonstrate commitment to a more sustainable future.
While some businesses may be overconfident, it’s hugely promising that the vast majority are motivated.  A clear-eyed, data-driven assessment will let them better see where they are, where they want to go, and how to get there. Then, organizations can align business and sustainability objectives, and build data-driven feedback loops that operationalize sustainability end-to-end.
Fortunately, technology that can help is improving every day. Survey data suggests organizations are leaning in; despite the complexities surrounding AI, 91 percent of respondents to IBM’s Sustainable Business Snapshot felt AI will play a positive role in helping them achieve their sustainability objectives. Forty percent reported already using AI in these efforts, with another 40 percent planning to adopt it soon.
As so many recent events make clear, building a more sustainable world has perhaps never been more important—or necessary. Confidence is high, and technology is available, but action needs to be commensurate. As COP28 approaches, let’s make sure we use every tool at our disposal for this important work.","ESG TOOLS, SERVICES/ GUEST POSTS",ESGTODAY
"October 4, 2023",EU Launches Anti-Dumping Investigation Against Chinese Electric Vehicles,"The European Commission announced today that is has officially launched an anti-subsidy investigation on imported electric vehicles from China, after finding that a surge in heavily subsidized EVs posed a threat to the EU’s automotive industry.
The investigation follows months of pressure from France on the Commission to initiate an anti-dumping probe against EV companies in China, although other countries such as Germany have warned that the move could spark a trade war.
EU Commission Ursula von der Leyen announced plans for the investigation last month in her State of the European Union (SOTEU) speech, in which she said that “global markets are now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars,” with prices that are being kept artificially low through “huge state subsidies” that are distorting the market.
The European electric vehicle market is anticipated to grow rapidly over the next several years, with regulations in place requiring a 100% reduction in CO2 emissions from new cars and vans registered in the EU from 2035, as well as a similar rule in place in the UK.  Sales of all-electric vehicles currently account for approximately 13% of the EU car market.
Announcing the official launch of the investigation, von der Leyen said:
“The electric vehicle sector holds huge potential for Europe’s future competitiveness and green industrial leadership. EU car manufacturers and related sectors are already investing and innovating to fully develop this potential. Wherever we find evidence that their efforts are being impeded by market distortions and unfair competition, we will act decisively.”
In a statement announcing the formal investigation, the Commission said that while no formal complaint had been received from EU industry, sufficient evidence had been gathered indicating that “the recent surge in low-priced and subsidised imports of electric vehicles from China into the EU posed an economic threat to the EU’s electrical car industry.”
The Commission said that it will determine whether it is in the best interests of the EU to remedy the effects of the unfair trade practices based on the outcome of the investigation, which could include the imposition of anti-dumping duties on battery electric vehicles imported from China.
Valdis Dombrovskis, EU Commission Executive Vice-President and Commissioner for Trade, said:
“Electric battery vehicles are crucial for the green transition and to meet our international commitments to reduce CO2 emissions. This is why we have always welcomed global competition in this sector, which means more choice for consumers and more innovation. But competition must be fair. Imports must compete on the same terms as our own industry.”",ENERGY TRANSITION/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY
"October 4, 2023",Brookfield Acquires one of UK’s Largest Renewables Developers,"Brookfield Asset Management announced the acquisition of Banks Renewables, one of the UK’s largest independent developers and operators of onshore wind farms from Northeast England-based family-owned business Banks Group. According to media reports, the deal values Banks Renewables at nearly $1 billion.
Founded by Banks Group in 2006, Banks Renewables owns and operates 282MW of renewable energy generation, including 11 onshore wind farms across Scotland and Northern England, and has a large-scale pipeline with planning permission for 307MW, and another 580MW in the planning system. According to Banks, the company’s operational projects have achieved a reduction of 620,000 tonnes of CO2 to date.
In addition to planning permissions for 15 new windfarms, the company is also developing renewable and flexible energy projects, including new solar arrays and a battery energy storage system.       
Banks Group Founder and Chairman Harry Banks said:
“The greater resources of Brookfield will enable the fuller development of opportunities which Banks Renewables are introducing.  It will be good for Banks Renewables’ employees and their career prospects, and it will be good for Brookfield because they are acquiring a renewables business with a proven track record and a capability to take the business forward.”
The deal marks the latest in a series of large-scale clean energy transactions for Brookfield, including the recent acquisition of Duke Energy’s commercial renewables business for $2.8 billion, and of renewable energy developer Scout Clean Energy for $1 billion.
According to the Financial Times, the deal is being done by Brookfield’s second Global Transition Fund. Launched earlier this year, the fund follows Brookfield’s record breaking inaugural Global Transition Fund, which raised $15 billion at final close last year, making it the largest private equity fund raised to date dedicated to facilitating the global transition to a net-zero carbon economy.
Sebastian Perl, Vice President at Brookfield, said:
“The United Kingdom is a high-quality location for renewable energy development and we are delighted to have made a further commitment to this market.
“We have a track record of being long-term owners of renewable energy businesses around the world and we see great potential to continue the great work that Banks Renewables has already achieved.”",ENERGY TRANSITION/ PRIVATE EQUITY,ESGTODAY
"October 3, 2023",Green Hydrogen Startup Electric Hydrogen Raises $380 Million,"Hydrogen electrolyzer manufacturer Electric Hydrogen (EH2) announced today that it has raised $380 million with the completion of its Series C funding round, with proceeds from the financing aimed at accelerating the company’s manufacturing and deployment plans.
Hydrogen is viewed as one of the key building blocks of the transition to a cleaner energy future, particularly for sectors with difficult to abate emissions, in which renewable energy solutions such as wind or solar are less practical. The development of clean hydrogen capacity, such as green hydrogen, which uses renewable energy to power the process to extract hydrogen from other materials, will require massive investments in areas including infrastructure, electrolysis, transport and storage.
Founded in 2020, Massachusetts-based EH2 manufactures powerful electrolyzers that produce green hydrogen from renewable electricity and water. The company is manufacturing 100 MW electrolyzer systems capable of producing nearly 50 tons of green hydrogen per day at low cost, to help decarbonize heavy industries, such as mining and steel. EH2 is currently installing manufacturing equipment in its 1.2GW factory in Devens, Massachusetts, which it anticipates will begin production of commercial electrolyzer systems in early 2024. The company said that it has more than 5 GW of electrolysis systems already reserved by customers.
EH2 CEO and co-founder Raffi Garabedian said:
“To address the global climate challenge, we need new technologies that help critical industries reduce their emissions. Electric Hydrogen’s 100MW electrolyzer systems do that. Today’s hydrogen comes from natural gas and coal and accounts for around 2.5% of global carbon emissions. There has not been a viable solution to this problem because renewable green hydrogen has been too expensive to produce at scale. The Electric Hydrogen team is changing that and the opportunities for decarbonization go far beyond today’s applications.”
The oversubscribed financing was led by metals and green energy company Fortescue, as well as Fifth Wall and Energy Impact Partners, and included participation from new investors bp Ventures, Oman Investment Authority, Temasek, Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund, the United Airlines Sustainable Flight Fund, New Legacy, Kajima Ventures and Fatima Holdings USA. Existing investors participating included Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, Equinor Ventures, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Rio Tinto, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Capricorn Partners, Prelude Ventures, and S2G Ventures. To date, EH2 has raised over $600 million.
In addition to the investment, Fortescue also signed a procurement agreement with EH2.
Mark Hutchinson, Fortescue Energy CEO, said:
“Fortescue is committed and focused on supporting the creation of green technology to help heavy industry decarbonize and producing green hydrogen at scale globally is integral to that. Electric Hydrogen, just like Fortescue, is working at the speed and scale necessary to help deliver green-hydrogen projects around the world.”",ENERGY TRANSITION/ PRIVATE EQUITY,ESGTODAY
"October 3, 2023",Austrian Airlines Found Guilty in Greenwashing Case over Carbon Neutral Flight Claims,"An Austrian court ruled that Austrian Airlines AG misled the public last year when it published ads offering CO2-neutral flights that used 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), between Vienna and Venice.
The greenwashing case was brought by Austria’s Association for Consumer Information (VKI). The ruling ordered the airline to publish information about the case on its social media.
Sustainable aviation fuel is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry, which currently accounts for 2-3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. SAF is generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, providing substantial emissions reductions relative to current fossil-based jet fuels. Currently, however, SAF represents only around 0.1% of the fuel used in aviation globally today according to the International Energy Agency.
According to the ruling, Austrian Airlines gave a false impression through advertising statements such as “Fly CO2-neutral with us,” or “100% SAF.”  Marketed for flights between Vienna and Venice, the campaign allowed consumers to pay a surcharge in excess of 50% of the ticket price for the CO2-neutral option, with the airline purchasing SAF to be added to future flights.
In its complaint, VKI noted that the maximum proportion of SAF was actually 5%, and that it is not currently possible to operate 100% SAF flights.
VKI lawyer Barbara Bauer said:
“In principle, we welcome all corporate efforts that serve to protect the environment. But promoting flights as CO2-neutral when this is not technically possible and it cannot even be ensured that sustainable aviation fuel is used in the specific flight is definitely going too far. The fact that consumers have to pay a hefty surcharge for this dubious service is a special treat of this marketing strategy.”
The case marked the latest in a series of greenwashing challenges for airlines. Austrian Airlines is a subsidiary of Lufthansa which was also found to have misled consumers through greenwashing earlier this year. UK regulator Advertising Standards Authority said that Lufthansa’s ads inaccurately insinuated that the airline “had taken significant mitigating steps to ensure that the net environmental impact of their business was not harmful.”
Additionally, BEUC, the European Consumer Organization, has filed a complaint against 17 EU airlines, including Austrian, for misleading climate-related claims. This includes claims that customers can pay extra credits to offset the CO2 emissions of the flight; charging flyers more and claiming that the extra cost contributes to the development of SAFs; or implying that air travel can be sustainable.",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT,ESGTODAY

"October 3, 2023",Nissan to Launch Only All-Electric Car Models in Europe Starting Now,"Nissan announced that all new models launched by the automaker in Europe going forward will be all-electric going forward, as the company aims to achieve 100% EVs in Europe by 2030.
The announcement follows Nissan’s launch in 2021 of its “Ambition 2030 Vision,” which placed vehicle electrification at the core of its long-term strategy, with plans for 2 nearly $18 billion of investments over five years, focused on building out its EV lineup and technology innovation.
Makoto Uchida, Nissan President and CEO said:
“EVs powered by renewables are key to us achieving carbon neutrality, which is central to our Ambition 2030 vision. Nissan will make the switch to full electric by 2030 in Europe – we believe it is the right thing to do for our business, our customers and for the planet.”
The transition to electric vehicles is considered essential to reaching global emissions targets. According to the International Energy Agency, private cars and vans were responsible for 10% of CO2 emissions in 2022. In Europe, between 2018-2022, sales of electric and electrified vehicles rose from 5% of the total market to 44%, with sales of all-electric vehicles rising from 1% to 12% of the total market.
Nissan’s 2030 deadline would place the automaker 5 years ahead of the EU’s target requiring a 100% reduction in CO2 emissions from new cars and vans registered in the EU from 2035, as well as the UK’s recently revised 2035 ban on petrol and diesel car sales. 
The transition to electric vehicles has been slower than hoped for, largely because of EVs price tag relative to cars that run on fossil fuels. Nissan said that it aims to launch EVs with its proprietary all-solid-state batteries (ASSB) by fiscal year 2028, which the company expects to bring the cost of battery packs down to $75 per kWh by fiscal year 2028, with a goal to bring it further down to $65 per kWh to achieve cost parity between EV and gasoline vehicles in the future.
Nissan also aims to introduce cobalt-free technology to bring down the cost of EV batteries by 65% by fiscal year 2028.
Uchida added:
“EV is the ultimate mobility solution. More than a million customers have already joined our journey and experienced the fun of a Nissan electric vehicle, and there is no turning back now.”",COMPANIES/ ENERGY TRANSITION,ESGTODAY
"October 3, 2023",EU Market Regulator Finds 4x Increase in Use of ESG Language in Fund Names,"The proportion of investment funds in Europe using ESG-related terms in their find names has grown by more than 4 times over the past 10 years, according to a new study released by EU markets regulator the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), as fund managers launched new ESG-related products, and changed the names of funds to incorporate sustainability-related terms.
The study also found a preference by fund providers for more generic ESG terms, which could make it difficult for investors to verify that investments align with the funds’ names, and that some fund documents targeted at retail investors are more likely to use ESG claims than those aimed at institutional investors.
The study forms part of ESMA’s monitoring efforts on greenwashing risks in the investment management sector. The regulator released a sustainable finance roadmap last year that included tackling greenwashing as a key priority, and has also recently launched a consultation for proposed rules on the use of ESG or sustainability-related terms in the names of investment funds.
ESMA’s study, and its focus on greenwashing in the fund management industry, comes as regulators globally are moving to address issues associated with the proliferation of investment products and services marketed with terms such as ’ESG,’ ‘green’ or ‘sustainable,’ without clear rules communicating to investors the actual ESG-related attributes, methodologies and criteria that are being considered in the funds.
The report noted that global sustainable fund assets have tripled over the last 3 years to over €2.1 trillion, and found that demand for funds in the EU with ESG-related terms in their names has exceeded demand for other funds consistently in every quarter over the past six years.
In the report, ESMA stated:
“It is necessary that ESG investment products be attractive to investors, given the tremendous financial resources that will be needed to finance the transition towards a greener economy… However, all else being equal, strong investor demand for ESG products also incentivize greenwashing behaviour among asset managers.”
Over the past ten years, ESMA found that funds including ESG-related language in their names have increased to 14% of assets under management in the EU in 2023, compared to only 3% in 2013, and have now reached €974 billion out of a total €6.8 trillion AuM. The increase gained momentum in 2016, following the 2015 Paris Agreement, and became “exponentially positive” from 2018 through the end of 2022, although the development of new ESG investment products has slowed in 2023.
In addition to the development of new funds, many products have changed their names to use sustainability-related terms, with 1,356 funds, representing 4.6% of EU-based actively managed equity, bond and mixed asset funds, adding ESG words to their name since 2018, with particularly sharp growth in 2021 and 2022.
The study found that the vast majority of funds that have chosen to include ESG language in their names have used more generic ESG-related words, such as “ESG” or “sustainable,” although noted that their has been an increase in the use of more specific environmental words since 2019. While ESMA noted that more generic terms enables fund managers to be more flexible in asset allocation and to target a more diversified portfolio, it also said that investors would be more easily able to verify whether the fund’s holdings were in line with the name if the terms used were more specific.
Applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to assess more than 100,000 fund documents, the ESMA study found that funds sold to retail investors are associated with more ESG claims in their standardized documents, such as Key Investor Information Documents (KIIDs) and Key Information Documents (KIDs) compared to funds sold to institutional investors, although this difference did not appear in investment strategy or marketing materials. ESMA noted that this “highlights the importance of monitoring this type of communication channel, from an investor protection perspective.”
ESMA added:
“The transition towards a greener economy will require substantial financial resources. To meet these investment needs, extensive private capital will be required. To ensure that ESG investment products remain attractive, it is crucial that investors have confidence that the sustainable financial products offered to them are accurately described.”

"October 2, 2023",Nestlé Launches Program to Provide Climate Risk Insurance to Coffee Farmers,"Global food and beverage company Nestlé announced today the launch of a pilot program to provide weather insurance to smallholder farmers in its Nescafé brand’s supply chain. The company said that the new program comes as climate change pressures coffee-growing areas, with smallholder farmers exposed to the risk of irregular weather conditions affecting their crops.
The new program aims to provide farmers with financial protection to cope with unpredictable weather patterns, using satellite-based climate data to determine if coffee output has been impacted by too much, or not enough, rainfall during key crop cycle phases, and issuing payments automatically to affected farmers, according to the severity of the weather.
Launched in collaboration with climate insurance specialist Blue Marble, the program is being piloted with more than 800 smallholder coffee farmers in Indonesia. Based on the results of the program, Nestlé said that it will determine whether to expand the initiatives to other Nescafé sourcing locations.
Jaime de Piniés, CEO of Blue Marble, said:
“Smallholder coffee farmers in Indonesia are vulnerable to climate risks and need access to insurance to protect against extreme weather events. We are proud to partner with Nestlé and its brand Nescafé to develop innovative ways to support the climate adaptation of smallholder coffee farmers and their families.”
According to Nestlé, the new program forms an integral part of its Nescafé Plan 2030. Launched last year, the plan outlines the coffee brand’s strategy to improve the sustainability of coffee farming, and help farmers transition to regenerative agriculture practices. Initiatives under the plan include providing farmers with training, technical assistance and high-yielding coffee plantlets, and working with farmers to test, learn and assess the effectiveness of multiple regenerative agriculture practices. The plan’s initiatives are focused in countries including Brazil, Vietnam, Mexico, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, Indonesia and Honduras, which represent 90% of the brand’s coffee sourcing. At launch, Nestlé said that the brand will invest over 1 billion Swiss Francs (USD$1 billion) by 2030 in the Nescafé Plan.
Marcelo Burity, Global Head of Nestlé’s Green Coffee Development, said:
“This weather insurance helps to establish a support mechanism for smallholder coffee farmers in Indonesia. It allows them to access financial resources to re-establish their crops in the event of irregular weather conditions while building resilience in coffee farms.”",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT/ SOCIAL,ESGTODAY

"October 2, 2023","Morgan Stanley, Stanford Launch Free Tool to Assess Business Activities’ Impact on Nature","Morgan Stanley’s Institute for Sustainable Investing and the Stanford University-based Natural Capital (NatCap) Project announced the development of a new tool aimed at enabling companies and investors to assess the potential impacts of projects and activities on natural ecosystems.
The new ecosystem footprinting tool is open-source and free for use.
According to Morgan Stanley and Stanford, the launch of the new solution comes as companies and investors are increasingly looking to consider and measure the impacts of their activities on natural assets such air, water, soil, and biodiversity, and how impacts to ecosystem services create risks and opportunities. Additionally, companies are likely to increase reporting on nature-loss and biodiversity, following the recent release by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) final recommendations for nature-related risk management and disclosure. The TNFD is providing a case study by NatCap about the new tool as additional guidance for the assessment of nature-related impacts and dependencies.
Lisa Mandle, Director of Science-Software Integration and a Lead Scientist at the Natural Capital Project, said:
“There have been criticisms of ESG because where companies’ metrics come from can be a bit of a black box. This tool can help with some of that reporting in a way that is very open and science-based, including for those following the TNFD framework.”
The new tool calculates the impact of human-made structures on ecosystem services based on their physical footprint on the landscape. According to Mandle, the solution would allow companies choosing between locations to develop a new facility to compare impacts, such as water quality from loss of ecosystems, people’s ability to access nature, as well as exposure to coastal flooding and erosion. Mandle said:
“We looked, for example, at lithium mines, which are key to the renewable energy transition: we can use satellite imagery to look at their footprint – how much space they are taking up – and the geography of where it’s located to assess its consequences. This could help determine where this resource could be obtained for the lowest environmental – and human – impact.”
Matthew Slovik, Managing Director and Head of Global Sustainable Finance at Morgan Stanley, said:
“Natural capital is a relatively new field as it relates to finance, but we believe it will be increasingly relevant to our clients. Investors are becoming more interested in using data to make informed decisions about natural capital and ecosystem services impacts, and we hope this tool can now support the market in that regard.”

"October 2, 2023",75% of Companies Not Ready for Pending ESG Data Assurance Requirements: KPMG Survey,"Only 1 in 4 companies are at advanced stages of preparation to obtain independent assurance on their reported ESG information, even though 66% are required to disclose ESG data or expect to be soon – including 78% of listed companies – according to a new survey released by global professional services provider KPMG.
For the study, KPMG surveyed senior executives and board members at 750 companies across a broad range of sectors and regions, with average company revenue of $15.6 billion, and launched the ESG Assurance Maturity Index, gauging progress companies have made in ESG policies, skills, systems and value chain data to prepare for ESG assurance.
The study comes as companies increasingly face regulatory, as well as stakeholder, pressure to report on an increasing range of ESG-related information, with many new and emerging disclosure systems, including the EU’s CSRD and U.S. SEC’s climate-related reporting rules, also requiring companies to obtain independent assurance on their sustainability reporting, similar to requirements for financial disclosure.
Maura Hodge, ESG Audit Leader at KPMG U.S., said:
“Assurance requirements are here. Soon, third-party assurance will no longer be a nice to have; it will be table stakes. While there are some larger companies that have been working to get ESG assurance ready, most companies haven’t built out much of the infrastructure that they need to have their ESG data assured. Now is the time for companies to establish their processes and become assurance ready.”
The KPMG study found that 75% of companies were still in the early stages of ESG assurance preparedness, despite the pending regulatory requirements, across a range of key factors including governance, skills, data management, digital technology and value chain, with even the top 25% of identified “Leaders” having significant work ahead to become ESG assurance ready. The study indicated that 56% of companies are publicly reporting ESG data, and while 93% of these are providing some level of external assurance, only 14% are obtaining reasonable assurance, and 16% limited assurance.
The report found differences in readiness by company size, region and sector, with larger firms (revenue above $10 billion) scoring well ahead of their smaller peers, North American and European companies outperforming those in Asia Pacific and Latin America, and the highest scores by industry in the Energy & Natural Resources and Manufacturing sectors, and the lowest in Technology & Telecommunications and Life Sciences & Healthcare.
While regulatory pressure, reported by 64% of respondents, is clearly the top driver for companies to obtain assurance over their ESG disclosures, the survey found executives anticipating a wide range of benefits from having their sustainability data assured, including 54% anticipating greater market share as customers and investors look to align their values with their consumption and investment decisions, as well as expectations for improved profitability, and decision making, greater innovation, and stronger reputation.
The study examined the top challenges experienced by companies in preparing for ESG assurance, with the most frequently cited by respondents including high initial costs and a lack of internal skills and experience (each reported by 44%), followed by a lack of clarity and evolving regulations (42%), inadequate supplier ESG performance (42%), insufficient IT or digital solutions (39%), and a lack of clear metrics or measurement tools (36%).
One of the primary hurdles to assurance readiness identified by the report was the establishment of an audit trail, or a record to trace accounting, trade details and non-financial data to their source to ensure the reliability and transparency of reported data. According to the survey, 74% of respondents acknowledged that they lack a clear audit trail for non-financial ESG information.
The collection of the required information also remains a significant barrier, with ESG data needing to be collected from a much wider range of disparate systems than financial data, and many companies facing requirements to report on a broad set of factors including environmental criteria and social data. The report found that currently, just over half of companies currently collect Scope 1 and 2 emissions data, only 36% capture Scope 3 data, and less than half capture data on metrics including the impact of workforce diversity and inclusion on employee retention, and pay equity.
In the report, KPMG International’s Larry Bradley, Global Head of Audit, and Mike Shannon, Global Head of ESG Assurance, said:
“To gain investor and stakeholder confidence and mitigate the risk of greenwashing, ESG reporting should be subject to a level of scrutiny comparable to the financial information that users depend on. This means that companies need to invest in and improve data quality by applying disclosure control and risk frameworks akin to those used in financial reporting.”

"September 28, 2023",Paine Schwartz Raises $1.7 Billion for Sustainable Food Chain Fund,"Food and agribusiness-focused private equity investor Paine Schwartz Partners announced that it has raised $1.7 billion at the final closing of the Paine Schwartz Food Chain Fund VI, L.P., focused on sustainable investments across the food value chain.
Launched last year, the fund has exceeded its initial fundraising target of $1.5 billion.
At closing, Fund VI is the largest fund dedicated to investing across the food and agribusiness value chainand is Paine Schwartz’s largest fund to date; the company’s previous Fund V raised $1.4 billion.
Fund VI is exclusively focused on sustainable investments in the fast-growing food and agribusiness sector. Paine Schwartz has already deployed approximately 40% the fund, including investments in AgroFresh Solutions, Costa Group, Elemental Enzymes, HGS BioScience and Monterey Mushrooms.
Paine Schwartz said that it will continue to seek attractive and actionable investment opportunities for Fund VI across two core themes: Productivity and sustainability: businesses that enhance agricultural productivity while limiting resource consumption; and health and wellness: businesses that provide access to healthier, more nutritious and safer food.
The Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD) has noted that the agriculture sector, together with forestry and other land uses, contributes nearly a quarter of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). But historically emission reductions from food production have received less support than those from other sectors such as energy and transport. Investment in mitigating climate impacts from the agribusiness industry is essential to prevent the industry from becoming a dominant source of global emissions by mid-century.
The fund attracted a diverse array of real asset, private equity and impact-oriented investors, including pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments / foundations, family offices and other institutional investors. Paine Schwartz completed the final closing of Fund VI within approximately one year of its first close.
Kevin Schwartz, Chief Executive Officer of Paine Schwartz said:
“With Fund VI, we are continuing to invest to feed a growing population better food with more efficient use of resources. Food and agribusiness has been the fastest growing sector for more than 15 years and continues to be underserved by the investment community. Guided by our core themes, we are targeting investments in segments associated with long-term growth that have limited commodity exposure and limited private equity competition. We look forward to leveraging our deep knowledge, industry relationships and thesis-driven approach to capture the numerous attractive value creation opportunities we see ahead.”",PRIVATE EQUITY,ESGTODAY

"September 28, 2023","Nucor, Helion to Build Fusion Power Plant to Decarbonize Steelmaking","Steel manufacturer Nucor and clean energy startup Helion announced an agreement to develop a 500 MW fusion power plant at a U.S.-based Nucor steel manufacturing facility, providing the facility with zero-carbon electricity.
According to the companies, the collaboration marks the first fusion energy agreement of this scale, and a significant milestone towards industrial decarbonization.
Nucor also announced a $35 million investment in Helion, aimed at accelerating fusion deployment in the U.S.
Nucor CEO Leon Topalian said:
“This project marks a tremendous milestone in the potential for the use of nearly limitless clean electricity for industrial manufacturing. By entering this agreement, we are demonstrating our commitment to be the cleanest steel producer in the world, while setting an example for all manufacturing companies.”
Fusion, the process of combining two atoms to form a single atom to release energy, has been long referred to as the “Holy Grail” of clean and abundant energy production, given its potential to produce power from hydrogen – the most common element in the universe – without producing carbon emissions associated with fossil-fuel based power, and without the highly radioactive output of nuclear fission processes. Large scale fusion energy generation has been elusive, however, given the need to create extremely high temperatures and pressure.
Founded in 2013, Helion’s approach to fusion generation includes technologies such as the use of a pulsed non-ignition fusion system to overcome some of the physics challenges of fusion and the use of deuterium and helium-3 as fuel. Helium-3’s properties enable smaller and more efficient systems, but the element has historically been very difficult to produce. Helion can produce Helium-3 utilizing a patented process that fuses deuterium in its plasma accelerator.
Helion is currently working on its seventh fusion prototype, which it expects to demonstrate the ability to produce electricity next year.
Steelmaking is one of the biggest emitters of CO2 globally, and one of the more challenging sectors to abate, with total greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the sector accounting for 7% – 9% of direct emissions from the global use of fossil fuels.
Nucor produces steel using recycled scrap metal in an electric arc furnace, enabling the company to operate with GHG intensity more than 60% below the global average. The company has committed to reducing its emissions intensity by 35% by 2030. One of the key methods to decarbonize its facilities is to increase the use of clean electricity. Currently, approximately 40% of the company’s electricity use comes from clean or renewable sources. The company estimated that deploying fusion at one of its largest mills could reduce emissions by 500,000 metric tons annually.
The companies said that they are committed to begin operation of the new fusion plant as soon as possible, with a target of 2030.
Helion CEO David Kirtley said:
“We’re passionate about helping the world reduce its dependence on carbon-based energy sources with abundant, clean fusion power. We are excited to partner with Nucor, a leader in decarbonization in the steel industry. A project like this is only made possible by working with a forward-looking company like Nucor which is committed to decreasing its carbon emissions.”",COMPANIES/ ENERGY TRANSITION,ESGTODAY
"September 28, 2023","SEC Chair Says Climate Disclosure Rule Feedback Pushes Back on Scope 3 Reporting as Less Developed, Unreliable","Many companies have raised concerns with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) plans to include Scope 3 emissions – those originating in areas outside of a company’s control, including the supply chain – as part of the reporting requirements under the Commission’s upcoming climate disclosure rule, according to testimony given on Wednesday by SEC Chair Gary Gensler to the House Financial Services Committee.
According to the SEC Chair, issues included the early stage of development and current unreliability of Scope 3 reporting.
Gensler said:
“Though many companies know their own greenhouse gas emissions, they don’t necessarily know… their entire supply chain and fewer public companies are currently publishing that. We put out a proposal to bring consistency to the disclosure, but we heard a lot of comments coming in to say Scope 3 disclosure is not as well developed, there’s not as many companies putting it out, and its frankly not yet as reliable.”
Gensler said that the Commission would take these concerns into consideration in drafting the final rules.
The SEC Chair added that some comments raised concerns about the impact of the rules on smaller businesses, particularly farms and agricultural companies that would not technically be covered by the new rules, but would be pressured to gather and provide emissions data to their customers who are impacted.
Gensler said:
“We, the SEC, don’t regulate these companies, those non-public companies, so staff is looking very closely to ensure that we stay within our authorities. It’s about the public companies.”
The SEC released its proposed climate disclosure rules in March 2022, which would require U.S. companies to provide information on climate risks facing their businesses, and plans to address those risks, along with metrics detailing the companies’ operational climate footprint, and in some cases emissions emanating across their value chains. 
Even if the SEC eases up on its supply chain emissions reporting requirements, however, many companies may find themselves required to provide Scope 3 details under other disclosure regimes. California Governor Gavin Newsom, for example, announced last week that he intends to sign new climate disclosure legislation into law which would require effectively require most large U.S. companies to disclose their full value chain emissions. Similarly, the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) extends the reporting requirements to non-European companies that generate over €150 million in the EU.
Commenting on the new California climate disclosure rules, Gensler said that if passed, they would effectively make the SEC’s rules less costly for companies, as many would be already be required to provide these disclosure elsewhere, but that it would also be important for the SEC to ensure that the reporting under these new rules would be accurate.

Trane’s climate goals include a target to reduce Scope 3 emissions, or value chain emissions outside of tis direct control, by 55% by 2030, as well as goals to achieve a 97% reduction in emissions per cooling ton from use of the company’s products, and a 90% reduction in GHG emissions across its global operations by 2050. Scope 3 emissions, including use of products and supply chain, make up the vast majority of the company’s carbon footprint.
Donny Simmons, President, Commercial HVAC Americas at Trane Technologies, said:
“With the heating and cooling of buildings representing about 15% of all global greenhouse gas emissions, the demand for more sustainable building solutions grows each day. Leveraging innovative AI-enabled solutions is one of many ways we are helping customers dramatically reduce their carbon footprints, while meeting business goals and doing the right thing for the planet.”","COMPANIES/ ESG TOOLS, SERVICES",ESGTODAY
"September 27, 2023",InterContinental Energy Raises $115 Million to Develop Green Hydrogen Projects,"Large-scale clean energy project developer InterContinental Energy, announced today that it received $115 million, including a continued strategic equity investment from institutional investor GIC, and a new equity investment from Hy24.
InterContinental will use the investment to accelerate the deployment of its portfolio of green hydrogen projects. The company is developing projects, based in Australia and the Middle East, and located in coastal deserts that provide wind and solar resources enabling cost-competitive green fuels at scale.
Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe. It can be burned for fuel, producing no CO2, only water. Creating pure hydrogen, however, has historically required the burning of fossil fuels, and ultimately resulted in more waste than just using the fossil fuels for energy. Green hydrogen, however, is made from CO2-free renewable energy. The International Energy Agency expects demand for green hydrogen to ramp up from 2030. But first there must be massive investments in areas including renewable energy capacity, infrastructure, electrolysis, transport and storage. 
In the first phase of its projects, InterContinental aims to deliver up to 10 GW of total installed renewables capacity before the end of 2030 with an overall ambition of nearly 100 GW.
Alex Tancock, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board for InterContinental Energy, said:  
“InterContinental Energy values the continued commitment from GIC since becoming our strategic investor in April 2022, which strengthens our ability to deliver on our green hydrogen vision. Hy24, as a new strategic investor, brings unrivalled industrial and financial knowledge in the hydrogen space as well as its critical network of key players across the value chain, to help unlock new opportunities for InterContinental Energy and all our stakeholders.”  
The market for green hydrogen is forecasted to reach between 450 and 600 million tons per annum (MTPA) by 2050. InterContinental Energy’s portfolio of projects is projected to produce more than 5 MTPA of green hydrogen to help offset more than 50 MTPA of CO2.   
Hy24’s investment is being made from its Clean Hydrogen Infrastructure Fund. Hy24 announced last year that had  raised €2 billion for its hydrogen impact fund, Clean H2 Infra Fund, making it the world’s largest infrastructure fund to exclusively invest in the clean hydrogen value chain.
Pierre-Etienne Franc, Chief Executive Officer of Hy24, said: 
“We launched Hy24 to catalyze the development of the hydrogen industry at scale, by investing in hydrogen leaders and entrepreneurs. In the long-term, InterContinental Energy represents this vision and has the most advanced execution plans for large, competitive renewable power basins. InterContinental Energy, with its existing team, its partnerships with world class energy players and investors, is set to become a premier player in the new energy system in the making.” ",ENERGY TRANSITION/ PRIVATE EQUITY,ESGTODAY

"September 27, 2023",Just Climate Launches Natural Climate Solutions Investment Strategy,"Climate solutions-focused investment business Just Climate announced announced the launch of its new Natural Climate Solutions (NCS) strategy, aimed at directing capital at scale globally to businesses focused on natural climate solutions, generating the highest climate impact as well as attractive financial returns.
Founded in October 2021 by Generation Investment Management, a sustainability-focused investment firm chaired by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, Just Climate aims to deliver impact by focusing on investments in projects and companies in hard to abate sectors and geographies, while simultaneously delivering appropriate risk-adjusted returns. The fund targets catalytic climate solutions in sectors including energy, transport, industry, and buildings and natural climate solutions for food, agriculture, and oceans.
While it originally also was focused on natural climate solutions for food, agriculture, and oceans, it did not have a dedicated strategy in that arena until now.
The launch of the new strategy follows Just Climate’s recent announcement that it has raised $1.5 billion for its inaugural fund, Climate Assets Fund I, closing the fund significantly ahead of its initial $1 billion target.
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, agriculture, forestry and other land use accounts for 23% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Natural climate solutions are projected to deliver close to 7 gigatons of CO2 abatement per year. That’s about a third of  the 2030 net emissions reduction targets required by the Paris Agreement.
Just Climate’s new NCS strategy will target businesses focused on natural climate solutions such as protecting, managing and restoring forests, wetlands and agricultural areas and avoiding emissions from agriculture, forestry and other land use. The fund will combine climate-related benefits of nature from physical commodity production to carbon storage, while contributing to biodiversity, pollination, nutrient cycling, and the quality and quantity of water provision.
The new fund will be headed by Eduardo Mufarej, Founder of Good Karma Partners, who has more than 25 years of experience as an investor, executive and entrepreneur, including in private equity and climate solutions.
Mufarej, who will serve as Co-Chief Investment Officer and Head of Natural Climate Solutions at Just Climate, said:
“Scaling natural climate solutions will involve building and growing businesses around the world that can advance sustainable agriculture, ecosystem restoration and durable carbon removal. The Global South has a key role to play, where both the growth opportunity and potential for impact are greatest. I am delighted to join Just Climate’s global leadership as we look to scale the platform.”
In addition to the launch of the new strategy, Just Climate announced that it has opened an office in Brazil. According to the firm, Having an office in Brazil, the company said, will enhance its capabilities and experience in key regions, such as Latin America, where many of the highest growth opportunities in natural climate solutions exist.
Clara Barby CBE, Senior Partner of Just Climate, said:
“We believe natural climate solutions are at a tipping point, and that an emerging ‘restoration industry’ can mirror the success of the renewable energy industry. “",INVESTORS/ NEW FUNDS & PRODUCTS/ PRIVATE EQUITY,ESGTODAY
"September 27, 2023",LEGO Group Appoints Annette Stube as Chief Sustainability Officer,"The LEGO Group announced today the appointment of Annette Stube, currently serving as Head of Sustainability at Stora Enso, as its Chief Sustainability Officer. She will assume her new role at LEGO Group on January 1, 2024, reporting to CEO Niels B Christiansen.
In a separate announcement today, LEGO Group confirmed recent media reports that it has dropped its plans to produce bricks from rPET plastics from recycled bottles, one of its key projects aimed at shifting away from fossil-based plastics and reducing its carbon footprint.
In her new role, Stube will have responsibility for leading LEGO Group’s environmental sustainability vision and strategy, working with teams across the company to deliver on its sustainability plans and targets, in addition to supporting the company’s external environmental communications and engagement activity.
The appointment follows a series of commitments announced by LEGO Group last month, including a pledge to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, work with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to develop emissions reduction targets covering Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as Scope 3 supply chain emissions, which account for 98% of the company’s carbon footprint, and to invest over $1.4 billion in environmental sustainability initiatives over the next three years.
Christiansen said:
“We are excited to have Annette join us to further advance our sustainability ambitions. Delivering on our Planet Promise is one of our most urgent and important challenges. While we have made significant progress over the past few years to reduce the impact our business has on the planet, we have much more to do.”
Stube joined pulp, paper and forest products company Stora Enso in 2020, and has been serving as Executive Vice President and Head of Sustainability. Prior to joining Stora Enso, Stube spent over 11 years at integrated container logistics company A.P. Moller-Maersk, serving as the company’s Head of Sustainability. She also worked as Director of Sustainability programs for global healthcare company Novo Nordisk.
Stube said:
“I am excited to join the LEGO Group and be part of the team helping to create a better environment for the benefit of future generations. There are very few companies who have children as their primary customers, which reminds us that the need for change is very real and urgent. It is encouraging to see the LEGO Group prioritise investments and resources against accelerating its sustainability ambitions and I am looking forward to playing my part to deliver those.”
One of LEGO Group’s sustainability strategy’s key focus areas includes initiatives to invest in sustainable materials research to reduce the carbon footprint of products and packaging. The company unveiled its first prototype bricks made from recycled plastic bottles in 2021, and stated that it would continue testing and developing the PET formulation of the new prototype brick, and then assess whether to move to the pilot production phase. The company announced today, however, that it has decided not to progress with the rPET bricks following two years of testing, after determining that it would not ultimately result in reduced carbon emissions.
In a statement announcing the decision, LEGO Group said:
“This is the nature of innovation – especially when it comes to something as complex and ambitious as our sustainable materials programme. Some things will work, others won’t.”
The company said that it is “more committed than ever to making our products and business more sustainable,” with a target to make its products from more sustainable and circular materials by 2032, adding that it has now tested more than 300 different materials. In a social media post, LEGO Group Vice President of Sustainability Tim Brooks noted that the company will triple its spending on sustainable materials to $400 million per year to 2025.
LEGO Group added:
“It’s a challenge we all share, and it’s something we know kids care about. We receive hundreds of letters from children each year with ideas of how we can be more sustainable. We want them to know we’re listening and trying hard.”",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT/ EXECUTIVE MOVES,ESGTODAY
"September 27, 2023",EU Bans Microplastics in Consumer Products,"The European Commission announced the adoption of a series of measures aimed at fighting microplastics pollution, including banning the sale of a broad series of products to which microplastics have been added, including cosmetics, detergents and toys.
Microplastics are often added to many products due to their applicability as filler, providers of texture, or as emulsifying agents, although they often are released into the environment and remain there for centuries, ending up in marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments, polluting ecosystems and food chains, and leading to negative health effects for humans and animals.
Virginijus Sinkevičius, Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, said:
“Banning intentionally added microplastics addresses a serious concern for the environment and people’s health. Microplastics are found in the seas, rivers and on land, as well as in food and drinking water. Today’s restriction concerns very small particles, but it is a big step towards reducing human-made pollution.”
Under the new rules, the sale of microplastics – covering all synthetic polymer particles below five millimeters that are organic, insoluble and resist degradation – and of products to which microplastics have been added on purpose will be prohibited, with products in the scope of the new restriction including granular infill material used on artificial sport surfaces, which is the largest source of intentional microplastics in the environment, and cosmetics, which use microplastics for purposes including exfoliation, texture, fragrance and color, as well as detergents, fabric softeners, glitter, fertilizers, plant protection products, toys, medicines and medical devices, among others.
Several products are not affected by the ban, such as construction materials that contain microplastics but do not release them, and products used at industrial sites, among others. While these products may continue to be sold, the new measures will require manufacturers to report their estimated microplastics emissions annually, and to provide instructions on the prevention of microplastics emissions in product usage and disposal.
While the rules will apply 20 days following the Commission’s adoption of the new measures for some products such as cosmetics containing microbeads, the ban will take effect for most products after a transition period, such as 4-12 years for other cosmetics, and 8 years for sport pitches.
The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) estimated that the cost of the new measures for stakeholders including, industry, sports clubs, and municipalities to be up to €19 billion over the next 20 years, with the new rules expected to prevent the release to the environment of about half a million tonnes of microplastics.
Thierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal Market, said:
“This restriction contributes to the green transition of the EU industry and promotes innovative, microplastic-free products – from cosmetics to detergents to sport surfaces. EU citizens will gain access to safer and more sustainable products and the EU industry – especially SMEs – which invested in and developed such innovative products will be more competitive and resilient.”",ENVIRONMENT/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY

"September 26, 2023",France Announces Plan to Cut Emissions 55% by 2030,"French President Emmanuel Macron unveiled the country’s “ecological plan” to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, in line with the EU’s interim climate goals.
According to the President’s presentation of the plan, reaching the 2030 goal will require a major acceleration in the country’s GHG emissions reduction progress, ramping to 5% per year through 2030, from around 2% annually over the past 5 years.
In order to kick-start progress, the strategy includes a plan to significantly ramp climate-focused investments to €10 billion next year, compared with €3 billion in 2023. Key areas of investment detailed under the plan include boosting building energy efficiency, developing energy technologies including hydrogen and renewable natural gas, and natural resources, farming, agriculture and forestry.
The plan also aims to boost clean mobility and renewable energy including developing offshore wind farms, producing 1 million electric vehicles by 2027 as well as opening 4 battery plants in Northern France, and investing €700 million in commuter train projects around big cities.
One of the plan’s key focus areas is on cutting reliance on fossil fuels. Macron announced that the country’s last coal-fired electricity generation plants will be closed by 2027 and converted to biomass energy plants.
According to Macron, the strategy will focus on incentivizing cleaner technologies rather than outright bans, with plans to introduce incentives to switch to electric vehicles and to install heat pumps.

"September 26, 2023",CBRE Signs Deal to Collect Emissions Data from Supply Chain,"CBRE Group, one of the world’s largest commercial real estate services and investment firms, has announced a strategic partnership with carbon accounting software provider Emitwise, aimed at enabling CBRE to collect greenhouse gas emissions data from its supply chain, and to provide its suppliers with carbon accounting capabilities.
CBRE said that it will also make a strategic investment in Emitwise as part of the partnership.
The real estate industry is one of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases, accounting for nearly 40% of global emissions. Most of those emissions, 70%, come from building operations with the other 30% coming from construction. Studies show that high emitting properties are seen as an investment risk and therefore have lower value.
The partnership will allow CBRE, its suppliers, and its clients’ suppliers to identify its greatest carbon impacts and take action to accelerate decarbonization, according to the company.
Robert Bernard, CBRE Chief Sustainability Officer said:
“Decarbonizing supply chains requires breakthroughs in using technology and data in new ways to simplify the challenges of managing complex value chains. We are excited to partner with Emitwise to help our clients reduce their carbon impact and support our efforts to decarbonize our own supply chain.”
In particular, Emitwise will advance the company’s net zero strategy by helping to track and reduce Scope 3 emissions.
Mauro Cozzi, Co-founder and CEO of Emitwise, said:
“Emitwise equips companies with the data they need to make critical procurement decisions that de-risk their supply chain in a world transitioning to net zero. We are thrilled to partner with CBRE on their efforts to reduce emissions across their supply chain.”","COMPANIES/ ESG TOOLS, SERVICES",ESGTODAY
"September 26, 2023",SEC Fines Deutsche Bank Subsidiary DWS $19 Million Following Greenwashing Investigation,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced on Monday that it has charged Deutsche Bank’s investment arm DWS, one of the largest asset managers in Europe, over misleading statements the firm made regarding its ESG investment process.
DWS has agreed to a $19 million fine to settle the charges, marking the largest-ever greenwashing penalty imposed on an asset manager by the SEC.      
The SEC announcement follows a 2-year investigation by the Commission, which was initiated after DWS’ former sustainability chief Desiree Fixler reportedly alleged that the firm misrepresented in its annual report the extent to which assets were invested using ESG integration in the investment process. Fixler was fired from DWS in March 2021 immediately prior to the release of the firm’s annual report.
In June 2022, German authorities raided the Frankfurt offices of Deutsche Bank and DWS following media reports that DWS overstated the green or sustainability-related aspects of financial products, and following examination of evidence leading to suspicion of “prospectus fraud.” DWS CEO Asoka Woehrmann resigned the following day.
According to a statement released by the SEC, the Commission found that DWS “made materially misleading statements about its controls for incorporating ESG factors into research and investment recommendations for ESG integrated products,” and that the firm failed to integrate aspects of its global ESG integration policy as marketed to clients. The SEC added that DWS failed to implement policies that would have ensured that its public statements about its ESG integrated products were accurate.
The announcement comes as the SEC is considering a series of proposed disclosure rules for funds and advisers that claim to integrate ESG factors into their investment products and services, aimed at providing clearer and more consistent information for investors, and to address the risk of greenwashing through the exaggeration or misrepresentation of ESG claims. Last week, the Commission adopted new rules that require funds with names that suggest an investment focus on ESG or sustainability-related factors to invest at least 80% of the value of assets in accordance with those factors.
Sanjay Wadhwa, Deputy Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement and head of its Climate and ESG Task Force, said:
“Whether advertising how they incorporate ESG factors into investment recommendations or making any other representation that is material to investors, investment advisers must ensure that their actions conform to their words. Here, DWS advertised that ESG was in its “DNA,” but, as the SEC’s order finds, its investment professionals failed to follow the ESG investment processes that it marketed.”
In a statement following the SEC announcement, DWS noted that the examination found “no misstatements in relation to our financial disclosures or in the prospectuses of our funds,” and that there was no intent by the firm to defraud, adding that the firm has already taken steps to address the weaknesses identified by the SEC.
DWS added:
“We have learned many lessons from the ever-evolving regulatory environment and are fully committed to continuing to improve. We are grateful to our clients for their continued trust in our products.”",INVESTORS/ REGULATORS,ESGTODAY
"September 22, 2023",DHL Invests $85 Million in Biomethane Production to Power Trucks,"DHL Group’s contract logistics division DHL Supply Chain announced an €80 million (USD$85 million) investment into a dedicated biomethane production facility in Cork, Ireland, run by biogas developer Stream BioEnergy.
DHL said that it will begin operating biomethane-fueled trucks, and has committed to a 10-year deal with Stream BioEnergy, with the new facility providing fuel for up to 150 trucks. The company said that the agreement will result in an annual carbon reduction of 15,000 tonnes.
Biomethane, or renewable natural gas (RNG), is expected to play a critical role in the transition to cleaner energy sources, particularly for sectors in which energy solutions such as wind or solar are less practical, such as transport. Biomethane is produced from organic waste, such as agricultural, industrial, and household wastes, and is chemically identical to fossil-based natural gas, enabling it to support the decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors such as road transport and heavy industry, without needing to replace existing transmission and distribution infrastructure.
Established in 2009, Stream BioEnergy develops and operates industrial-scale biogas projects in Ireland, utilizing anaerobic digestion technology to convert organic materials into renewable energy  and biofertilizer. The company’s Cork-based biomethane production site will process 90,000 tonnes of industry and consumer food waste annually, which would have otherwise been sent to landfill.
DHL said that the deployment of biomethane trucks, and the investment in biomethane production will support its efforts to achieve its 2050 net zero target. DHL launched its Sustainability Roadmap in 2021, which included plans to invest €7 billion over ten years in measures to reduce its CO2 emissions, with a focus on the expansion of a zero-emissions fleet, alternative aviation fuels, and climate-neutral buildings.
In addition to the investment, DHL a collaboration with Tesco, which will see DHL operating 92 biomethane trucks across Tesco Ireland’s network, once the new biomethane facility is fully functioning.
Managing Director of DHL Supply Chain, Ireland, Ciaran Foley said:
“We are extremely proud to be enhancing renewable energy production here in Ireland and our collaboration with Tesco marks a significant step in our shared journey towards achieving net-zero emissions. Our customers’ transport networks are a vital focus area when looking at how they can achieve their overall sustainability goals so by making alternative fuels a reality we can really prove our value as a strategic partner.”
Tesco Ireland’s Retail and Distribution Director Ian Logan added:
“We have one of the most sophisticated distribution networks in the country, and improving its efficiency and environmental impact will play an important role in our journey to net zero. Our current HGV transport fleet makes over 2,000 trips weekly, serving our growing network of 166 stores nationwide, so moving to a cleaner fuel in our value chain will play a vital role in achieving this.”",COMPANIES/ ENERGY TRANSITION,ESGTODAY

"September 21, 2023",Microsoft Signs Deal to Buy Biochar Carbon Removal Credits,"Carbon credit streaming company Carbon Streaming announced an agreement with Microsoft, providing the tech giant with up to 10,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide removal credits per year from the Waverly Biochar project in Waverly, Virginia.
Biochar, or biological charcoal, is produced by heating biomass, such as forest residue, wood or crop waste, in the absence of oxygen, creating a stable form of carbon, which when buried in soil enables centuries-long carbon sequestration, in addition to leading to improved soil fertility.
The Waverly Biochar project, under development by Restoration Bioproducts LLC, involves the construction of a biochar production facility, and is expected to remove over 262,000 tCO2e of emissions over its 25-year project life. Carbon Streaming has a royalty on the biochar that is expected to be produced and sold by the project.
Oliver Forster, Vice President of Sales at Carbon Streaming, said:
“We are delighted to be working with Microsoft to provide them with high quality and scalable carbon dioxide removals to support their carbon negative commitment. We’re particularly excited about the capacity for biochar to scale this decade with support from visionary organizations such as Microsoft.”
The agreement marks a further expansion of Microsoft’s portfolio of carbon removal deals, forming part of the company’s initiative to become carbon negative by 2030, and to remove all of its historical emissions by 2050. The company signed one of the largest-ever Direct Air Capture (DAC) carbon removal agreements earlier this month with DAC technology company Heirloom, and has recently announced DAC-based agreements with climate tech company CarbonCapture and with startup Climeworks, an agreement for ocean-based carbon dioxide removal with ocean health company Running Tide, and an agreement for the purchase of 2.76 million tonnes of carbon removal with Danish energy provider Ørsted to capture and store biogenic carbon from a wood chip-fired power station in Denmark.
In its recently-published Carbon Removal briefing paper, Microsoft described Biochar as “the mainstay of our medium-durability portfolio and plans” for carbon removal, “that bridges the durability and cost gap” between shorter-duration solutions such as afforestation, and longer-duration but higher cost solutions such as DAC.
Most solutions that capture and store CO2 are early stage and currently limited in scale, including biochar, with corporate commitments to offtake carbon removal credits from the projects helping to send a demand signal to suppliers to enable the solution to scale up.

"September 21, 2023",Emissions Tracking and Reporting Software Startup Plan A Raises $27 Million,"European carbon measurement, reporting and reduction software provider Plan A announced that it has raised $27 million, with proceeds from the financing aimed at growing its team and expanding its platform’s capabilities.
Founded in 2017, Plan A provides corporate carbon accounting, decarbonization, and ESG reporting software. The company’s Sustainability Platform automatically maps data across Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions, merging them with national emission factors and datasets, enabling users to set and achieve science-based targets, and to self-manage the net zero process from data collection and decarbonization planning to non-financial reporting. The platform’s solutions are aligned with internationally recognized scientific methodologies and standards such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and the accuracy of the applied Corporate Carbon Footprint (CCF) calculation methodology is certified by TÜV Rheinland.
Plan A has grown its customer base to more than 1,500 clients, and increased revenues more than 600% year over year in 2022.
The company said that it will use the funds to double its headcount to 240 employees in order to expand in Europe, especially France, the UK, and Scandinavia. It also intends to advance its platform’s Scope 3 coverage and actionability and policy alignment capabilities.
Lubomila Jordanova, CEO of Plan A, said:
“Climate change and the associated impacts pose an existential risk to businesses. We are over the moon to bring these stellar investors onboard the Plan A journey today to back us in navigating the complexity of corporate decarbonisation and address climate change on a global scale.”
The funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and included Visa—with whom Plan A signed an exclusive global partnership – Deutsche Bank, Opera Tech Ventures (VC arm of BNP Paribas), and existing investors such as HV Capital, Keen Venture Partners, Demeter IM, and coparion.
Julie Kainz, Partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, said:
“We’ve been closely following the journey of Lubomila and the entire Plan A team over the past years and it has become incredibly clear to us that they have positioned themselves as a leader in this space. The strength and flexibility of their platform truly has the capabilities to drive change and impact within organisations from across any sector and on a global scale, and to guide organisations both small and large on a holistic decarbonisation journey.”","ESG REPORTING/ ESG TOOLS, SERVICES/ PRIVATE EQUITY",ESGTODAY
"September 21, 2023",IBM Adds Scope 3 Emissions Analysis Capabilities to ESG Data Platform,"IBM announced the integration of natural language processing (NLP) in its ESG data collection, analysis and reporting platform IBM Envizi ESG Suite, significantly enhancing the solution’s ability to capture, calculate and analyze organizations’ Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
The new features come as companies globally face increasing regulatory pressure to report on their Scope 3 emissions, or those originating in their upstream and downstream value chains, with emerging sustainability reporting standards including the EU’s CSRD and the IFRS’ ISSB standards requiring Scope 3 disclosure . While Scope 3 emissions often account for the majority of many companies’ carbon footprint, they are typically the most challenging to track and report as they occur in areas outside of the companies’ direct control. Alongside the release of the new features, IBM announced the results of a survey of global business leaders which found that only 38% currently measure Scope 3 emissions.
IBM acquired Envizi in 2022, as part of its efforts to enhance its AI-powered ESG solutions capabilities. While the IBM Envizi suite already offers coverage for all Scope 3 emissions categories, the company said that the integration of NLP’s text classification capabilities will help to “enable a leap forward in efficiency and accuracy.”
IBM added that the new functionality will enable the categorization of spend data drawn from financial or ERP systems, which it described as one of the key challenges facing organizations with managing Scope 3 emissions data.
The company said that it has also added a spend-based emissions factor library to IBM Envizi, harmonized across over 180 countries, aimed at helping organizations produce Scope 3 calculations for purchased good and services quickly, accurately and efficiently.
Christina Shim, Vice President and Global Head, Product Management and Strategy, IBM Sustainability Software, said:
“Growing regulatory requirements and external interests are driving organizations to disclose GHG emissions, including those from Scope 3. As requirements increase and as organizations prioritize enhancing operational insights, so does the need for robust, auditable data management, calculation, and reporting processes. IBM Envizi is now integrated with the new capabilities to help organizations seamlessly garner insights from spend data to facilitate Scope 3 emissions calculations for ESG reporting.”","ESG REPORTING/ ESG TOOLS, SERVICES",ESGTODAY
"September 21, 2023",SEC Adopts Rule Requiring ESG-Labelled Funds to Invest 80% in Alignment with Theme,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced the adoption of new rules that will require   funds with names that suggest an investment focus on ESG or sustainability-related factors to invest at least 80% of the value of assets in accordance with those factors.
The SEC action consists of an amendment of the Commission’s “Names Rule,” first adopted in 2001, as a measure to prevent fund names from misrepresenting their inherent investments and risks, which included a requirement for investment companies with names that suggest a focus on a certain type of investment to adopt a policy to invest at least 80% of the value of their assets in those investments.
The adopted amendments expand the 80% rule to apply to funds with names that suggest a focus on investments with particular characteristics. While not applying only to ESG funds – funds labelled as “growth” or “value” would also be included, for example – the ruling focused heavily on ESG funds, noting the rapid increase in investor interest in funds that offer ESG strategies and the proliferation of such funds, as well as the growing potential for greenwashing due to the wide range of ESG-related terms and evolving investor expectations.
The final rule noted that use ESG-related terms such as “sustainable” or “green” present “particular investor protection concerns,” as “funds that consider ESG factors in their investment strategies comprise a thematic area that entails unique considerations, and that involves the use of terminology that may be especially powerful in fund names to attract investors.”
SEC Chair Gary Gensler said:
“Today’s final rules will help ensure that a fund’s portfolio aligns with a fund’s name. Such truth in advertising promotes fund integrity on behalf of fund investors.”
The final rule did not include action in an initial proposal that would have defined the use of ESG terms in the names of “ESG integration funds” as “materially deceptive and misleading.” ESG integrations funds consider ESG factors alongside other non-ESG factors in investment decisions, although the ESG factors are not more significant than the other factors. In a statement announcing the new rule, Gensler said that this aspect of the proposal is still under consideration.     ",INVESTORS/ REGULATORS,ESGTODAY

The agreement follows the release in March 2022 by the EU Commission of a set of proposals to amend the EU’s existing rules aimed at protecting consumers from unfair commercial practices such as untruthful or aggressive advertising and providing consumers with information on products, to include considerations relating to the green transition. A recent study by the Commission found that more than half of green claims by companies in the EU were vague or misleading, and 40% were completely unsubstantiated.
Alberto Garzón Espinosa, Acting Spanish Minister for Consumer Affairs, said:
“Citizens are suffering the consequences of climate change and want to be part of the solution. With the compromise reached today consumers will have the necessary information to make the right green choices and will be better protected against green washing, social washing and other unfair commercial practices. This is essential to allow them to play an active role in the common struggle for a greener and fairer Europe.”
Under the new agreement, the EU’s rules will be updated to ban generic environmental claims such as “environmentally friendly” or “climate neutral,” unless proof of “recognised excellent environmental performance” is provided, along with claims that a product has a positive or reduced impact on the environment based on emissions offsetting. The new rules also prohibit the use of sustainability labels that are not based on approved certification schemes, and also includes rules addressing early obsolescence.
EU Parliament rapporteur Biljana Borzan said that with the new rules, lawmakers are “clearing the chaos of environmental claims, which will now have to be substantiated, and claims based on emissions offsetting will be banned.”
Following the provisional agreement, the new rules will advance for formal endorsement and adoption by the Council and Parliament.",GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY
"September 20, 2023","Businesses, Investors Push Back on UK’s Watered-down Climate Goals","Automotive giant Ford issued a harsh response to UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s plan to push back the country’s ban on the sale fossil fuel-based cars, arguing that the move will undermine government consistency needed to enable investment in the industry’s transformation.
The government, under former PM Boris Johnson, announced in 2021 that the UK will end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030, as part of a series of “Green Industrial Revolution” commitments and investments that also included measures to scale the production of clean and renewable energy, reduce the carbon footprint of homes and other buildings, increase carbon capture capacity and support the development of climate solution technologies.
Sunak announced today, however, that in order to “ease the burden on working people,” he will delay or eliminate several of the UK’s climate initiatives, including pushing back the ban on petrol and diesel car sales by 5 years to 2035, delaying and easing rules to transition away from oil and gas boilers and towards heat pumps, and removing home energy efficiency requirements, as well as ending moves to incentivize reduced air travel and meat consumption.
In a statement posted on Ford’s website, Lisa Brankin, Ford UK Chair said that the auto industry has been investing to meet the 2030 deadline, and noted that the company has already invested £430 million on development and manufacturing facilities in the UK, “with further funding planned for the 2030 timeframe.”
Brankin added:
“Our business needs three things from the UK government: ambition, commitment and consistency.  A relaxation of 2030 would undermine all three.”
Sustainable investment groups also warned of the potential impact of policy uncertainty on the UK’s ability to attract capital flows driving the climate transition. In a statement posted following Sunak’s announcement, Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) CEO Stephanie Pfeifer said that “clear and consistent policymaking is a prerequisite for investors looking to make long-term investment and asset allocation decisions and for maintaining their confidence.”

"September 20, 2023",TNFD Releases Framework for Reporting on Nature-Related Risks and Opportunities,"The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) announced the publication of its long-awaited final recommendations for nature-related risk management and disclosure, aimed at helping inform better decision-making by companies and capital providers on nature and biodiversity-related risks, opportunities, dependencies and impacts, as well as to contribute to a shift in financial flows towards nature-positive outcomes and the achievement of global biodiversity and ecosystem preservation goals.
The launch of the new framework marks a major step towards enabling enhanced corporate sustainability reporting, with the TNFD’s guidelines anticipated to be used to help shape the development of future sustainability disclosure standards. The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) of the IFRS Foundation, for example, which recently launched its landmark sustainability and climate reporting standards, has already announced that the TNFD recommendations will inform its future standard setting, and environmental disclosure platform CDP stated that it plans to align its global disclosure platform with the TNFD framework.
David Craig, Co-Chair of the TNFD and founder and former CEO of Refinitiv, called the release of the recommendations a “step-change” towards enabling companies and financials to “identify, assess and disclose their exposure to nature-related issues in a manner consistent with climate-related-reporting.” Craig added:
“Nature loss is accelerating, and businesses today are inadequately accounting for nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities. Nature-risk is sitting in company cash flows and capital portfolios today. The costs of inaction are mounting quickly. Businesses and financial institutions now have the tools they need to take action.”
The publication follows a two-year process, beginning with the formation of the TNFD in June 2021, building on the success of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and led by a taskforce of 40 members, including senior executives from across a broad range of sectors and disciplines, encompassing Financial Services, Corporates, and Market Service Providers, and representing over US$20 trillion in assets under management.
The publication includes 14 recommended disclosures, aligned under the same 4 contextual pillars utilized by the TCFD, which include Governance, with disclosures covering board oversight and management’s role in assessing nature-related dependencies, impacts risks and opportunities; Strategy, encompassing the effects of these issues on business models, strategies and financial planning; Risk and impact management, including the processes used to identify, assess, prioritize and monitor nature-related issues in direct operations and in the value chain, and; Metrics and targets used to assess material nature-related dependencies, impacts risks and opportunities.
In addition to the disclosure recommendations, the TNFD also released a set of recommended indicators and metrics for assessment and to support disclosure, as well as a suite of additional guidance aimed at helping organizations to get started with the TNFD recommendations and with the identification and assessment of nature-related issues.

"September 20, 2023",Guest Post: Why Should Sustainability Reporting be the Boardroom’s Top Priority?,"By: Dr. Jan-Hendrik Gnändiger, Global ESG Reporting Lead, KPMG
The world is in flux. Business leaders are facing a myriad of crises and challenges – from rising interest rates and inflation to supply chain blockages, driven by the war in Ukraine.
You might argue that now is not the time to be adding to the growing to-do list for CEOs and other corporate decision makers, but the reality is that there’s no going back on sustainability.
In recent months, political leaders and organizations have ramped up their response to sustainability. Years of dialogue are finally shifting toward action – in a matter of months, the first tranche of mandatory ESG reporting regulations will come into force in the EU and will even impact many companies not headquartered there. For boardrooms, that means greater clarity on what’s expected and should be a wake-up call for any leaders who doubt change is on the horizon.
The big shift toward greater global regulation began with the publication of the first of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) Standards. The ISSB was founded with a clear goal of creating a global baseline of sustainability disclosures – to address the fragmentation of frameworks globally and to drive greater consistency and comparability. On the regulatory side, IOSCO – the international body of securities’ regulators – has endorsed the ISSB Standards and countries are considering how to incorporate them into their regulatory frameworks.
In parallel, the European Commission has also made substantial progress – developing the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and most recently adopting the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) for any companies falling within the CSRD’s scope beginning from 2024 onwards and including a clear assurance obligation. Hot on the heels of their European and international counterparts, the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US is finalizing its climate rule.
Time is running out to get ready for the new ESG reporting requirements. But this goes beyond compliance. The world’s northern hemisphere has just witnessed a summer of wildfires and storms – reflecting the growing battle we’re facing against a climate crisis. For businesses, it’s more important than ever to play a key role in delivering a more sustainable, equitable future – one that works for us all, and respects the planet that provides us with the resources that enable us to flourish.
For CEOs, a raft of regulatory change can be daunting, but it’s important to reflect on why this is happening. Although there will inevitably be some divergence and bureaucratic challenges ahead, the goal is to create a more streamlined, consistent approach to how companies report on ESG. In KPMG’s 2022 CEO Outlook survey, nearly 70 percent of leaders told us they were facing rising public, investor and stakeholder pressure for increased ESG reporting and transparency. Meanwhile, changing regulations and global economic uncertainty were viewed as the greatest barriers to tackling ESG.
The data clearly reflects a growing commitment to ESG, but one that’s matched with a fear that reporting could become increasingly complex and contradict the ultimate goal of consistency in reporting. That’s why, with multiple incoming frameworks, standard setters and other stakeholders are keen to maximize the overlap in the requirements and hence their interoperability.
If you’re a business leader and you’re wondering what steps to take, my advice is clear. Companies need to take action now to ensure they’re ready for the changes ahead. The first steps should be assessing which new requirements impact your operations and determining what is material. These should be followed by a relentless focus on data collection – ensuring you’re monitoring all material aspects of your business and turning that data into insights which can assist with reporting.
Companies can then use this data to develop a strategic roadmap, plotting a more sustainable, transparent route ahead that factors in any potential risks or opportunities for growth. In addition, it is not just a matter of setting up a new ESG reporting process, but also about preparing for assurance on ESG reporting under the new requirements.  
Sustainability reporting is complex and, for an already overwhelmed boardroom, there is a danger it could slip down the growing list of urgent priorities. For leaders, seek advice from experts, convene and plan. The crises driving the need for changes to sustainability reporting show no sign of abating any time soon, so further mandatory regulation is inevitable. It’s an opportunity for the business community to take a leading role in driving positive change.

"September 19, 2023",U.S. Treasury Releases Principles for Net Zero Commitments by Financial Institutions,"The U.S. Treasury announced today the publication of its new “Principles for Net-Zero Financing & Investment,” aimed at establishing a set of best practices, and promoting consistency and credibility for private sector financial institutions in making and pursuing net zero commitments.
Introduced as voluntary principles, the new publication focuses primarily on financial institutions’ Scope 3 financed and facilitated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which typically account for the vast majority of financial firm’s carbon footprint.
According to a Treasury statement announcing the publication, the Principles come as a “massive economic shift” is underway, driven by the climate crisis, resulting in increasing demand for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction technologies, products and services, clean energy, and climate adaptation solutions across sectors. While these shifts are fueling the growth of new industries and business models, the Treasury added, building these new industries will require “a private financial system that allocates increasing amounts of capital and expertise to the companies and people building this new clean energy economy.”
The statement added:
“The Principles that Treasury is unveiling are intended to support this growth.”
The publication includes 9 Principles, which establish that net zero goals set by financial institutions should be in line with the goal of limiting the increase in global average temperature to 1.5°C, and that the goals should be accompanied by a net zero transition plan. Financial institutions are also guided to establish credible metrics and targets for all relevant financing, investment, and advisory services, to align their engagement practices with client and portfolio companies with their net zero commitments, and to be transparent about their goals and progress towards them.

"September 19, 2023",Only 1 in 4 Companies Very Confident in Meeting ESG Reporting Requirements: KPMG Survey,"Companies increasingly expect their ESG strategies to contribute to positively to business and financial outcomes, in areas ranging from M&A and new product opportunities to talent and customer retention, although many executives are concerned about keeping up with complex and changing sustainability regulatory requirements, with only around a quarter reporting confidence in meeting ESG reporting requirements across several jurisdictions, according to a new survey released by professional services firm KPMG.
For the study, the “KPMG U.S. ESG Survey,” KPMG surveyed more than 200 business leaders with responsibility for aspects of their companies’ ESG strategy, at companies with more than $1 billion in revenue across multiple industries.
While 92% of those surveyed were at companies headquartered in North America, 67% said that they will be required to report on ESG in 3 or 4 jurisdictions.
The survey indicated that business leaders see an increasing connection between their sustainability and corporate strategies, with 43% of respondents reporting that their companies’ business and environmental goals are now more closely aligned than they were 5 years ago. This result is particularly strong among larger companies (10,000+ employees), at 66%.
The business leaders identified M&A efficacy as the top area in which ESG is adding value to their businesses, with 41% reporting that ESG engagement adds major financial value, with other top areas including access to new capital sources at 35% and customer retention at 34%.
Going forward, the executives identified a broad range of areas expected to generate from value creation resulting from their sustainability efforts, with some of the biggest gains anticipated in areas including attracting new customers, with 40% anticipating greater financial value in 2-5 years, talent recruitment and retention (37%), increased revenue from premium pricing (37%), and lower cost of capital (38%).
As the business leaders anticipate generating value and opportunities from their sustainability strategies, many have reported refocusing on ESG activities. While a KPMG survey last year indicated that 59% were planning on pausing or reconsidering their ESG efforts in light of economic uncertainty, the new survey found that 55% actually scaled up their ESG efforts despite potential recession, while only around a quarter scaled back.
Rob Fisher, KPMG U.S. ESG Leader, said:
“These results underscore that ESG provides businesses with a clear opportunity to differentiate themselves and gain a competitive edge. We found businesses see many levers by which ESG can drive financial value, but that also drives complexity for organizing a cohesive, well-understood strategy that can overcome some very real challenges businesses are facing today.”
While the executives reported growing pressure to increase transparency on their sustainability progress and efforts, the greatest source of this pressure did not come from regulators, but instead from supply chain partners, with 88% of respondents saying that these stakeholders are demanding ‘some’ or ‘a great deal’ of increased ESG reporting and transparency (vs 80% for regulators). Other top sources of demand for more ESG transparency are coming from employees (82%), institutional investors (81%) and customers (81%).
While pressure builds from multiple stakeholders to improve transparency, however, only around half of respondents (53%) reported being at least somewhat confident in their ability to meet sustainability reporting requirements in the U.S., and only a quarter feel confident that they can meet future ESG reporting requirements in the U.S., EU and other areas, with two-thirds expecting to be required to report in 3 to 4 jurisdictions.
Additionally, while the SEC has extended its process in finalizing its own climate-related reporting rules, initially introduced in March 2022, and with the final rules expected later this year, more than 40% of survey respondents said that have slowed or entirely halted ESG reporting.
Maura Hodge, KPMG U.S. ESG Audit Leader, said:
“For many companies, ESG reporting requirements are already here even as we await the SEC’s final rule. While convergence has begun, organizations will undoubtedly struggle to navigate the web of global requirements as we determine the interoperability of the standards. The very cautious confidence among companies on reporting underscores the urgency to align one’s reporting approach with business strategy today.”
Major challenges reported by the respondents to meeting ESG reporting requirements included finishing environmental reporting data on time for their 10K filings, with 50% citing this as a “major” or “very significant” challenge, followed by the cost of resources and talent to manage reporting (46%) and investing in data collection, management and reporting (46%). Additionally, 45% reported that aligning their sustainability strategies with reporting requirements also posed a major or very significant challenge, while measuring Scope 3 emissions did not crack the top 5 challenges categories.
Fisher added:
“ESG’s wide-ranging impacts and levers make it an incredibly unique coordination challenge for leaders. The risk of falling behind can compound, turning today’s headache into a long-term struggle as competitors pull away. The upcoming reporting requirements should ignite urgency to align one’s reporting with strategy today.”

"September 18, 2023","Mercedes-Benz Signs Deal to Buy More than 50,000 Tonnes of Low Carbon Steel Annually for U.S. Production","Automotive manufacturer Mercedes-Benz announced today an agreement with U.S.-based steel producer and metals recycler Steel Dynamics for the supply of more than 50,000 tonnes of CO2-reduced steel annually for its plant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
The CO2-reduced steel is anticipated to be introduced into series production at the plant as early as this month.
Steel Dynamics (SDI) produces steel using electric arc furnace (EAF) technology, which uses recycled ferrous scrap as the primary raw material, and does not require the smelting of virgin iron ore or the burning of coal, generating substantially lower levels of carbon emissions with less energy intensity relative to traditional blast furnace steelmaking technology.
According to the companies, the steel supplied by SDI will use electricity from 100% renewable sources, which enables EAF-produced steel production to reduce emissions by more than half compared to primary steel production which uses blast furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces. SDI recently signed a 308 MW Renewable Product Purchase Agreement (RPPA) with NextEra energy, the largest of its kind to date for the North American steel industry.
Mercedes-Benz’s Tuscaloosa plant produces SUV models including the GLE, GLE coupé and GLS model series, as well as the all-electric EQS SUV and EQE. All models built in the plant currently use SDI flat rolled steel made of 70% or greater recycled scrap content, and the companies said that they have agreed to potentially increase the share of scrap in the near future, which would further reduce carbon footprint.
Mercedes-Benz stated earlier this year that it is pursuing a goal to achieve a green steel supply chain from 2039 at the latest, as part of a series of ESG-related goals and initiatives announced by the company at its ESG Conference to investors and analysts, which also included a target to achieve an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions from production by 2030.

"September 18, 2023",Norway’s $1.4 Trillion Wealth Fund Tells Portfolio Companies Not to Count Carbon Credit Towards Interim Climate Goals,"Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), the investment manager for Norway’s $1.4 trillion oil fund announced the publication of a new set of climate-related expectations for portfolio companies, including requirements to disclose value chain emissions, report on climate risks, and implement transition plans.
The investment manager also released its view on the use of carbon credits, including its expectation that portfolio companies should not count carbon credits towards their interim emissions reduction targets.
NBIM was established to manage revenues from Norway’s oil and gas resources. The fund has grown to one of the world’s largest, owning nearly 1.5% of all shares in the world’s listed companies, with holdings in over 9,000 companies in 70 countries.
The new guidance for portfolio companies follows the release of NBIM’s climate action plan last year, which included a target to reach net zero emissions for all companies in the fund by 2050, and a plan to set climate-related expectations for companies in its portfolio, including a requirement to set net zero goals.
With the new publication, NBIM explained that engaging with portfolio companies is “at the heart of the action plan,” and that the new expectations could be used as a reference point for this process, for engagement activities including dialogues, filing and voting shareholder proposals, and board member election voting. NBIM added that the expectations will also guide its investment analysis and risk management.
Carine Smith Ihenacho, Chief Governance and Compliance Officer at NBIM, said:
“With the effects of climate change becoming more evident, we really saw the need to sharpen our expectations. We look forward to having even more valuable engagements with companies and their boards on this important topic. We think the core expectations will be particularly useful in our board level dialogues.”
The publication includes a set of six core expectations, covering board oversight, with boards responsible for ensuring that climate risks and opportunities are embedded in company strategy and risk management; climate risk disclosure, asking companies to analyze and disclose how climate risks may impact their operations, value chains and demand for products; greenhouse gas reporting, which NBIM said should include Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and including assurance for at least Scopes 1 and 2; commitments to net zero by 2050; setting science-based interim targets covering Scope 1, Scope 2 and material Scope 3 emissions and consistent with net zero by 2050, and; transition plans, with companies setting time-bound, quantified plans to deliver on their interim targets, and including annual progress disclosure.
In its related guidance on the use of carbon credits, NBIM acknowledged that “carbon credits can help finance much-needed mitigation and sequestration opportunities globally,” and that they can “help finance much-needed mitigation and sequestration opportunities globally,” although the investment manager added that the priority for portfolio companies should be on reducing their own emissions, and that “carbon credits should not be counted towards progress on near-term science-based emission reduction targets.”
In addition to a need to prioritize emissions reductions, NBIM outlined some concerns with carbon credits, including the quality of certain offset projects, and the potential to distract from emissions reduction efforts and investments.
The investment manager included additional elements for the credible use of carbon credits, detailing that they should represent additional and verified emission reductions, and represent durable CO2 removal.
In its guidelines on the corporate use of carbon credits, NBIM added:
“The lack of transparency on how companies are using voluntary carbon credits in the context of their climate commitments presents a challenge for investors when evaluating the credibility and progress of companies’ climate commitments and achievements. Investors holding portfolios with widespread use of low-quality carbon offsetting may underestimate the climate risk they are exposed to.”
To address these issues, NBIM also called for improved transparency on companies’ use of carbon credits, including identifying their use in corporate reporting and encouraged companies to disclose the price of the credits purchased in the voluntary carbon markets (VCMs).

"September 18, 2023",California Governor Commits to Sign Climate Disclosure Bills into Law,"“Of course I’m going to sign those bills”
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced on Sunday that he plans to sign two new landmark climate-related disclosure bills into law, which will require most large companies in the U.S. to disclose their full value chain emissions, as well as requiring companies to report on their climate-related financial risks and adaptation measures.
Both bills, SB 253, the “Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act” and SB-261, “Greenhouse gases: climate-related financial risk,” passed in the California Assembly last week, advancing the bills to the Governor’s desk, who has until October 14 to sign the bills.
Asked at a Climate Week NY event on Sunday if he intends to sign the bills, Newsom highlighted California’s leadership over the past several decades on climate-related legislation, including introducing the U.S.’ first cap and trade program and tailpipe emissions requirements, introducing low carbon fuel standards, and requiring sales of only alternative fuel cars in the state by 2035.
Newsom continued:
“Would I cede that leadership by having a response that is anything but ‘of course I will sign that bill?’
“No, I would not. Of course I’m going to sign those bills, and California will continue to maintain that leadership.”
The Governor added, however, that there remains some “modest cleanup on some little language” in the bills before they are signed.
Newsom noted that SB 253, requiring $1 billion+ revenue companies to disclose greenhouse gas emissions will apply to more than 5,300 businesses, including multinationals, and “some of the most well-known businesses in the world.” He added that several large companies have recently indicated their support for the bills, including Apple and Salesforce.
As passed in the Assembly, SB 253 would require companies with revenues greater than $1 billion that do business in California to report annually on their emissions from all scopes, including direct emissions (Scope 1), emissions from purchase and use of electricity (Scope 2), and indirect emissions, including those associated with supply chains, business travel, employee commuting, procurement, waste, and water usage (Scope 3).
Disclosure obligations would begin in 2026 for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and in 2027 for Scope 3 emissions, with measurement and reporting to be performed according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol standards. The law would also require companies to obtain third party assurance for their emissions reporting, starting with a limited assurance level beginning in 2026 for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and at a more stringent reasonable assurance level in 2030, and at a limited assurance level for Scope 3 in 2030.
SB 261 applies to U.S. companies that do business in California and with revenues greater that $500 million to prepare a report disclosing their climate-related financial risk, in accordance with the TCFD framework, as well as measures to reduce and adapt to that risk. Prior to approval in the Assembly, the bill was amended to move the date of first disclosures to 2026 from 2024, and to require reporting every two years instead of annually.
The new laws would introduce the first major mandatory climate-related reporting obligations for many U.S. companies, although there are others likely to apply to U.S. companies as well. The SEC is preparing the final version of its own climate-related disclosure rules for U.S. companies, following the release of an initial proposal in March 2022. The California law would go farther in some ways than the proposed SEC rules, applying to all large companies, as opposed to only public companies, and including all Scope 3 emissions. Many U.S. companies will also have to comply with the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which includes mandatory climate and sustainability-related reporting obligations for large companies on doing business in Europe.
Following the Governor’s announcement, California Senator Scott Wiener, who introduced SB 253 earlier this year, said:
“In announcing he will sign SB 253, Governor Newsom is reaffirming California’s global climate leadership. These carbon disclosures are a simple but intensely powerful driver of decarbonization. When business leaders, investors, consumers and analysts have full visibility into large corporations’ carbon emissions, they have the tools and incentives to turbocharge their decarbonization efforts.”
Sustainability-focused nonprofit Ceres, who had co-sponsored the bills, also welcomed the announcement. In a statement following Newsom’s remarks, Ceres President and CEO Mindy Lubber said:
“In so many ways, California has been a leader in the nation and around the world by pioneering the bold climate and energy policies necessary to confront the climate crisis and capitalize on the massive economic opportunity in the clean energy transition. Now, the state is poised to set another leading standard to increase corporate transparency and help to mitigate financial and climate risk.”",ESG REPORTING/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY

"September 15, 2023",Galvanize Raises Over $1 Billion for Decarbonization Solutions Venture Fund,"Climate-focused investment firm Galvanize Climate Solutions announced the final close of its Innovation + Expansion Fund, its first venture and growth equity fund, at over $1 billion, marking one of the largest climate venture funds raised to date.
Galvanize was launched last year by hedge fund billionaire and former presidential candidate Tom Steyer and Hall Capital Partners founder Katie Hall, as a mission-driven investment platform to provide capital, expertise and partnerships necessary to produce and scale urgent climate solutions.
Steyer said:
“Fully realizing the most significant investment opportunity of our time and succeeding in ushering in the climate transition will require more than capital alone. That’s why, based on years of investment experience and an understanding of the resources needed to accelerate critical climate solutions, we deliberately built Galvanize to forge a new model for climate investing, alongside constructing a world-class team built for this moment.”
The Innovation + Expansion Fund invests in early- to growth-stage climate transition-aligned companies, providing capital and interdisciplinary resources to help them accelerate to commercial scale. The fund’s investment approach targets companies with a clear route to leadership in end-markets expected to grow substantially in the climate transition, those with the potential for substantial value creation through Galvanize’s resources and relationships, and business models allowing for compelling returns through differentiated technology, network effects, and scale economics.
To-date, the fund has invested in 11 companies across sectors including electricity, transport, industry, buildings, agriculture and carbon removal.
Saloni Multani, co-head of Innovation + Expansion at Galvanize, said:
“We are witnessing an inflection point in the transformation of the global economy. The alignment of market forces – including corporate commitments, regulatory and policy progress, consumer expectations, workforce talent preferences, technological maturation and economic competitiveness – is driving substantial tailwinds behind the climate sector. We believe immense value will accrue to the technologies and solutions that can drive meaningful decarbonization over the next decade.”",INVESTORS/ PRIVATE EQUITY,ESGTODAY

According to Lloyd’s, the new solution is being developed as insurers face the challenge of meeting GHG emissions reporting requirements from current frameworks such as Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR), as well as other regulations coming into force such as the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the  International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).
Rebekah Clement, Director of Corporate Affairs at Lloyd’s said:
“A robust and credible emissions measurement process will allow us to meet our regulatory reporting requirements while improving transparency across the Lloyd’s market. Moody’s have established expertise in this field and are well placed to help us achieve this.”
Under the new collaboration, Lloyd’s and Moody’s will develop a solution aimed at accurately assessing Scope 3 emissions defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s 15th category, or those associated with investments and financing activities. Scope 3 emissions are typically the most difficult to track, given limited availability of data and external company disclosures.
Andy Frepp, General Manager – Risk Solutions at Moody’s Analytics, said:
“Building on our unique experience in delivering specialised sustainable solutions and analytics to brokers, carriers, and reinsurers, we are excited to help the Lloyd’s market quantify its insurance and financed-associated carbon emissions by leveraging our extensive carbon and financial data, advanced name-matching algorithms, and the knowledge of our climate and insurance experts.”
The collaboration will begin with a 12-week proof of concept exercise as part of Lloyd’s “Lab Challenge Programme,” which has been established to experiment with new product ideas and accelerate product development to tackle insurance industry challenges. The starting point for the solution’s emissions measurement will be the Principles for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) standards. The PCAF launched its Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for Insurance-Associated Emissions last year, designed to enable insurance and reinsurance companies to measure and disclose GHG emissions associated with their underwriting portfolios.
Dawn Miller, Commercial Director at Lloyd’s, said:
“A regulatory imperative is coming within the next three years, and the Lloyd’s Lab can play a useful role by helping the market get to a better, swifter, and more consistent outcome.”","ESG REPORTING/ ESG TOOLS, SERVICES/ SUSTAINABLE FINANCE",ESGTODAY

"September 14, 2023",Volvo Signs Deal for Low Carbon Steel with H2 Green Steel,"Truck, bus and construction equipment company Volvo Group announced today a new agreement with Swedish startup H2 Green Steel to purchase low-carbon steel for use in its commercial vehicles, with deliveries beginning in 2026.
Steelmaking is one of the biggest emitters of CO2 globally, and one of the more challenging sectors to abate, with total greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the sector accounting for 7% – 9% of direct emissions from the global use of fossil fuels.
Founded in 2020, H2 Green Steel is developing its flagship green steel plant in Boden, Sweden, with the project including a giga-scale green hydrogen plant as an integrated part of the steel production facility. The company employs hydrogen produced using green power to remove the oxygen from iron oxide, avoiding most of the CO2 emissions normally produced, and uses electricity from 100% renewable sources for the energy requirements generated in the manufacturing process. H2 Green Steel aims to begin production in 2025, with plans to produce 5 million tons of nearly fossil-free steel by 2030.
The deal follows last week’s announcement by H2 Green Steel that it raised €1.5 billion in equity to finance the new plant’s construction.
Volvo is the latest in a series of automotive sector buyers of H2 Green Steel, with recent agreement also including Scania, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW.
Henrik Henriksson, H2 Green Steel’s CEO, said:
“The commercial vehicle industry has actively been driving the demand for green steel, validating the market interest. When an undeniable large player like Volvo Group, working at the forefront of sustainable change, places a customer order it’s a clear sign of confidence in both our company and our product.”
According to Volvo Group, the announcement will support the company’s goal to achieve a net zero GHG emission value chain by 2040, a target set by the company in 2021. The company has also sourced fossil-free steel through its collaboration with steel manufacturer SSAB.
Andrea Fuder, Chief Purchasing Officer of Volvo Group, said:
“Collaborations which support our work to reduce emissions are crucial on the path towards net zero. Steel is a big contributor to the footprint of our products, and working together with both established and new players for developing decarbonized materials is key to advancing our progress in sustainable transport and infrastructure solutions.”",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT,ESGTODAY
"September 14, 2023",Mars Commits to Cut Emissions in Half Across Full Value Chain by 2030,"Snacking, food, and pet care products provider Mars announced today a series of new climate-related goals, including a target to cut carbon emissions across its full value chain in half by 2030, and to invest over $1 billion over the next three years to drive climate action.
The new commitments were unveiled as part of Mars’ newly released Net Zero Roadmap, outlining the company’s action plan to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions across its full value chain, a goal set by the company in 2021.
Mars CEO Poul Weihrauch said:
“2050 can seem to be in the distant future, but the progress we make in the next seven years is critical. My generation of CEOs has the ability and responsibility to deliver actual emission reductions and put business on a clear path to Net Zero by 2050. That’s why Mars is committed to delivering a 50% reduction in GHG by 2030. We cannot wait for the economy to improve; we must push forward with investments that protect our business today and in the future.”
The company outlined several of the initiatives and focus areas it will pursue to achieve its net zero goals, including transitioning to renewable energy – including addressing the energy used by farmers and by customers – redesigning supply chains to stop deforestation by enhancing transparency and traceability of key ingredients such as cocoa, soy, and beef, working with farmers on regenerative agriculture and other smart agriculture initiatives, and improving and optimizing logistics.
Mars also said that it will embed climate action in its governance and business planning, including in variable remuneration plans of senior executives, as well as in its investment planning and M&A strategy, and by including climate action as a shareholder objective.
Barry Parkin, Mars Chief Sustainability and Procurement Officer, said:
“Mars has always followed science, and science says we must cut our emissions across our full value chain by 50% by 2030. Science points us to five fundamentals that Net Zero roadmaps should consider to deliver real impact, for example that there is no place for exclusions or exceptions and that we must prioritize performance over promises. In preparing our roadmap, we’ve learned that this is both entirely possible to deliver with existing science and technology as well as entirely affordable.”
The company said that its emissions peaked in 2018, and that it has already reduced absolute emissions by 8%, or 2.6 million metric tons, on a 2015 basis, despite 60% business growth over that period. Cutting emissions in half by 2030 would eliminate approximately 15 million tons of emissions.
Weihrauch added:
“Profit and purpose are not enemies. Investment in climate is not a trade-off between planet and productivity, or between environment and employment. Consumers and our Associates clearly want both – and so do we. Investing in emissions reductions is sound business policy, it is achievable, affordable, and it is absolutely necessary.”",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT,ESGTODAY
"September 14, 2023",EU Commission Considers Requiring Sustainability-Related Disclosures for All Financial Products,"The EU Commission on Thursday announced the launch of a consultation on its sustainable financial disclosure practices, including questions asking for feedback on introducing sustainability-related disclosure requirements for all financial products offered in the EU, even if those products have not made any sustainability claims.
The Commission’s consultation is focused on the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), which sets out how financial market participants, such as asset managers, have to communicate sustainability information to investors, regarding the integration of sustainability risks and the consideration of adverse sustainability impacts in their processes and the provision of sustainability‐related information with respect to financial products.
The regulation includes classification levels for sustainability-focused investment funds, each with varying disclosure requirements, including ‘Article 8’ funds that “promote environmental or social characteristics or a combination of those characteristics,” and the more stringent ‘Article 9’ funds, “which have sustainable investment as their objective.”
One of the regulation’s key requirements, and among the most challenging for asset managers, is for reporting on Principal Adverse Impact (PAI) that investment decisions have on a broad range of sustainability factors, such as climate and environment, as well as social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and anti-bribery aspects.
While the consultation explains that the SFDR was designed to require products that make sustainability claims “to disclose information to back up those claims and combat greenwashing,” it notes that these requirements “could be viewed as placing additional burden on products that factor in sustainability considerations,” and asks respondents to consider if all products “regardless of related sustainability claims,” should have uniform disclosure requirements.
The consultation adds that this move could also have the benefit of allowing investors to understand products’ sustainability performance even for products that don’t make sustainability claims.
The consultation continues to ask what disclosure requirements should be considered for all financial products, listing taxonomy-related disclosures, engagement strategies, exclusions, and information about how ESG-related information is used in the investment process.
In addition to the potential disclosure requirement changes, and questions about the current functioning of the SFDR regulations, the EU Commission’s consultation also included questions on developing more “precise EU-level product categorisation system based on precise criteria” for sustainable financial products beyond its current “Article 8 and 9” categories.
Following the launch of the consultation, Mairead McGuinness, Commissioner for Financial Services, Financial Stability and Capital Markets Union, said:
“Sustainability information is key to empowering investors to make informed decisions on their investments. Since the Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation (SFDR) was proposed in 2018, a lot has changed in the world of sustainable finance. Today we are launching an in-depth three-month consultation for stakeholders. We want to know if our rules meet their needs and expectations, and if it is fit for purpose.”

Founded in 2015, SBTi was formed as a collaboration between CDP, World Resources Institute (WRI), the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), and the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), with the goal to establish science-based environmental target setting as a standard corporate practice. The organizations’ key functions include defining and promoting best practice in emissions reductions and net-zero targets in line with climate science, providing technical assistance to companies who set science-based targets, and providing companies with independent assessment and validation of their emissions reduction targets.
SBTi said that the move to separate the standard-setting and target validation entities will help to boost credibility and integrity, and is in line with best practice for assurance bodies. The organization added that it is in the process of strengthening its standard setting processes, following the appointment of an independent technical council.
In addition to the structural transformation, SBTi announced a series of key governance changes, including incorporating the organization in the UK, establishing itself as independent from its founding organizations.
SBTi also announced the appointment of Francesco Starace, formerly CEO of Italian energy giant ENEL, as Chair of the SBTi’s Board of Trustees, and also named former President in Colombia Iván Duque and  Novozymes CEO Ester Baiget as Trustees, with plans to introduce 2 – 3 additional trustees over the next year.
Starace said:
“I am very impressed by the momentum the SBTi has built since its inception. Today, the organization validates thousands of companies’ targets each year. The SBTi plays an important role in encouraging ambitious corporate climate action, which relies on credible target validation and robust standard-setting. I feel honored to join as Chair during this phase of rapid growth.”
SBTi also unveiled plans to increase its target validation capacity in order to meet significant demand growth. The organization saw an increase of 87% last year in the number of companies setting targets.
Luiz Amaral, SBTi CEO said:
“The moment for accelerating corporate climate action is right now. This action must be built on trust as businesses require the highest level of credibility for their targets. This year we have witnessed the three hottest months ever recorded, we must accelerate on all fronts. When I joined last year, my key remit was to build out the SBTi’s governance, while scaling up the organization in the face of enormous demand. I am elated to have an industry leader like Francesco Starace join as our Chair and welcome all of the new appointees on this important journey.”",EXECUTIVE MOVES/ PROFESSIONAL BODIES,ESGTODAY

The new ETF tracks the MSCI AC Asia ex Japan Climate Action Index, which forms part of the recently-launched MSCI Climate Action Indexes. MSCI introduced its Climate Action Index suite last year, aimed at enabling investors to invest in companies making progress towards emissions reduction targets. The indexes consist of companies taking measurable steps to reduce emissions, and provides exposure to all economic sectors, by selecting the top 50% of companies in each GICS sector based on factors including Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions intensity, approved science-based targets, management of climate risks, and green business revenue.
Michael Syn, Senior Managing Director and Head of Equities, SGX Group, said:
“SGX Group plays a vital role in galvanising stakeholders within the financial ecosystem to mobilise capital and develop solutions to effect real change in addressing climate change. With the market and investors signalling their readiness for it, we have been working in partnership with BlackRock and MSCI to create a new global ecosystem of climate-related instruments such as this ETF and the climate action derivatives that were launched earlier this year.”
The launch of the new ETF comes as Singapore endeavors to establish itself as a hub for sustainable finance in Asia, and to attract capital from investors looking to align their investments with climate considerations. In 2019, Singapore’s central banks and financial regulator, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), launched a Green Finance Action Plan (GFAP) aimed at mobilizing capital to facilitate Asia’s low carbon transition, updated earlier this year with its more comprehensive  Finance for Net Zero (FiNZ) Action Plan.
Gillian Tan, Assistant Managing Director and Chief Sustainability Officer for MAS, said:
“The successful launch of the iShares MSCI Asia ex-Japan Climate Action ETF is the outcome of close collaboration between SGX Group, MSCI and BlackRock, and adds to the suite of innovative products in Singapore that supports transition and decarbonisation efforts in Asia. Looking ahead, Singapore welcomes the development of solutions that facilitate decarbonisation, while meeting the investment and risk management needs of issuers, asset owners and investors in the region.”",INVESTORS/ NEW FUNDS & PRODUCTS/ PLATFORMS & MARKETS,ESGTODAY

The approval marks one of the last major steps to advance the proposal into law, with the legislation now awaiting formal approval by the EU Council. The Council reached a provisional agreement on the law with Parliament in March 2023.
The new 2030 target would nearly double the share of renewable energy in the EU’s energy mix from approximately 22% in 2021. The legislation also directs EU Member States to endeavor to collectively achieve a renewable energy target of 45%.
The new law would also significantly raises the EU’s renewable energy goal from its current 2030 target of 32%, and even above the initial 40% goal proposed by the European Commission’s “Fit for 55” roadmap, the EU’s proposed strategy to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. That target was raised to the 45% goal in May 2022 with the EU’s REPowerEU Plan, as part of the strategy to rapidly reduce reliance on Russian fossil fuels in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
In addition to raising the mandated share of renewables, the legislation aims to speed up the permitting process for new renewable energy power plants, with approvals of under 12 months in areas designated as “renewables go-to areas,” identified under the REPowerEU plan as locations that are particularly suitable for the installation of renewable energy plants and in which deployment is not expected to have significant environmental impacts. In other areas, the approval process should not exceed 12 months under the new rules.
Sector targets under the legislation include reaching at least a 49% renewable energy share in buildings by 2030, as well as measures to gradually increase renewable targets for cooling and heating, a 14.5% reduction in transport sector emissions by 2030 through increased renewables deployment, requirements for industry to increase the use of renewable energy annually by 1.6% and for 42% of the hydrogen used in industry to come from renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs) by 2030, and 60% by 2035.
In order to advance the development of new sources of clean energy, the legislation also sets an indicative target for at least 5% of newly installed renewable energy capacity by 2030 to be “innovative renewable energy technology.”
Lead MEP Markus Pieper (EPP, DE), said:
“In our pursuit of greater energy independence and CO2 reduction, we have raised our renewable energy targets. This directive is evidence that Brussels can be unbureaucratic and pragmatic. We have designated renewables as an overriding public interest, streamlining their approval process… We now urgently need an EU electricity market design and an immediate shift to hydrogen for a greener transition”.",ENERGY TRANSITION/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY
"September 13, 2023",Salesforce Adds CSRD Reporting Capabilities to Sustainability Platform,"CRM solutions provider Salesforce announced today a series of new features for its Net Zero Cloud sustainability management solution, including capabilities supporting companies required to meet upcoming European sustainability disclosure requirements, and AI-based features to help streamline ESG reporting.
Salesforce launched Net Zero Cloud in 2019 (as “Sustainability Cloud”) to provide users with a 360-degree view of their environmental impact with the ability to track, analyze and report reliable environmental data, and has announced a series of updates including the release of Net Zero Cloud 2.0 last year, integrating solutions from across the company’s portfolio including supplier collaboration technology and CRM dashboards, the addition of social and governance data management capabilities in December 2022, and the integration of capabilities enabling users to automate the disclosure of ESG data in alignment with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards earlier this year.
The platform’s new capabilities come as companies globally are coming under increasing pressure to meet climate and ESG regulatory requirements, including the EU’s upcoming Corporate Sustainable Reporting Directive (CSRD).
The CSRD will significantly expand the number of companies required to provide sustainability disclosures to over 50,000 from around 12,000 currently – including large non-EU companies – and introduce more detailed reporting requirements on company impacts on the environment, human rights and social standards and sustainability-related risk. Some companies will be required to begin reporting under the CSRD as soon as 2024.
Net Zero Cloud’s new capabilities include CSRD Report Builder, which automates report generation in alignment with CSRD requirements, including double materiality, and Materiality Assessment, helping companies to identify ESG topics that are most material to their business. The EU’s reporting rules allow companies to focus reporting primarily on sustainability factors that they consider material to their businesses, based on materiality assessments.
Salesforce also unveiled Einstein for Net Zero Cloud, with anticipated availability in Spring 2024, utilizing Salesforce’ Einstein AI platform’s capabilities to suggest auto-generated responses for ESG reports, in line with specific reporting framework criteria.
Ari Alexander, VP and GM of Net Zero Cloud, Salesforce, said:

"September 13, 2023",United Signs Deal for up to 1 Billion Gallons of Sustainable Aviation Fuel,"United Airlines announced today that it has signed an offtake agreement with decarbonization-focused industrial biotech company Cemvita for up to 1 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from CO2.
Under the new agreement, Cemvita will provide United with up to 50 million gallons of the CO2-based SAF annually over 20 years.
Sustainable aviation fuel is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry, which currently accounts for 2-3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. SAF is generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, providing substantial emissions reductions relative to current fossil-based jet fuels.
Many current techniques used to produce SAF, however, may face difficulty in reaching the scale required to support these ambitions, with required feedstocks often in limited supply.
Founded in 2017, Houston-based Cemvita uses industrial biotech to provide solutions including natural extraction of natural resources, carbon negative chemical production, and the closed-loop renewal of waste as feedstock. The company’s solutions include synthetic microbes that have the potential to convert CO2 into SAF, addressing SAF feedstock issues, and requiring minimal land, water, and electricity needs. The company added that its eCO2 plants have the potential for carbon negative output, and aim to be cost competitive with existing crop-based feedstocks and fuels.
Moji Karimi, CEO of Cemvita, said:
“Biology is capable of truly amazing things. Our team of passionate, pioneering, and persistent scientists and engineers are on a mission to create sustainable BioSolutions that redefine possibilities.
“We are thrilled to partner with United Airlines in working towards transforming the aviation industry and accelerating the energy transition.”
United Airlines has committed to fully reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 without relying on carbon offsets. Earlier this year, the company launched the United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight Fund, aimed at investing in and supporting startups focused on SAF research, technology and production.
The fund, which has grown to over $200 million of commitments, prioritizes investments in new technology, advanced fuel sources and proven producers, aimed at supporting the scaling of SAF supply. Cemvita was announced as part of the fund’s inaugural group of portfolio companies.

"September 13, 2023",Apple Launches its First Carbon Neutral Products,"Apple announced the launch of its new Apple Watch lineup, incorporating a series of sustainability features in the product line, and touting the new products as the company’s first to achieve carbon neutrality.
According to the company, the achievement marks a major step towards its goal to reach carbon neutrality across its full product lineup, including in the supply chain and product use, by the end of the decade. The target forms part of Apple’s ambition to become carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030, a goal set by the company in 2020.
Lisa Jackson, Vice President of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives at Apple, said:
“We’ve achieved an important milestone in making the world’s most popular watch carbon neutral — and we will keep innovating to meet the urgency of the moment.”
Apple outlined the criteria its uses to ensure carbon neutrality for each watch, including using 100% clean electricity for manufacturing and product use, 30% recycled or renewable material by weight, and 50% of shipping without the use of non-air modes of transportation, such as ocean shipping.
The company added that it will match 100% of customers expected electricity use for charging with renewable energy. Product use accounts for over 20% of Apple’s carbon footprint.
Overall, the company said that its design innovations and clean energy use have reduced product emissions for each Apple Watch model by at least 75%, with high-quality carbon credits used to address the remaining emissions footprint. Apple uses carbon credits from projects certified by international standards, mostly from nature-based projects that remove carbon from the atmosphere, like restoring grasslands, wetlands, and forests.
Apple’s efforts to decarbonize its products focus on electricity, materials, and transportation, which are the three primary sources of emissions across the product life cycle.
Emissions from the manufacturing supply chain represent more than 70% of Apple’s carbon footprint, with electricity use as the single largest contributor. Apple established a Supplier Clean Energy Program in 2015, offering suppliers resources including information about renewable energy procurement options, training materials, country-specific information, data insights, and engagement opportunities with renewable energy experts as well as policy advocacy. The company recently revealed that more than 250 suppliers across 28 countries, representing over 85% of the company’s direct manufacturing spend, have now committed to using renewable energy for all Apple production by 2030, and that the use of renewable electricity by its manufacturing partners increased by nearly 30% in 2022.
The company has aims to make its products using only recycled or renewable materials, and it has announced that it has ended the use of leather across all of its product lines. Apple announced its first entirely fiber-based packaging for the new Apple Watch, as well as 99% fiber-based packaging for the iPhone 15.
To address transport emissions, Apple said that it is shifting more volume to shipping modes such as rail or ocean, supporting the development of sustainable aviation fuels, and selecting vendors that offer low-carbon options for transport.
Apple also the launch of Grid Forecast, a new tool in the Home app enabling users to decide when to use electricity for energy-intensive appliances based on timing when the electricity grid is using cleaner energy sources, utilizing data that combines grid, emissions, and weather information.
Jackson said:
“At Apple, we have a longstanding and proven commitment to leading the fight against climate change. Our focus on renewable energy and low-carbon design has already driven industry-leading emissions reductions, and we’re not slowing down.”",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT,ESGTODAY

"September 12, 2023",Nestlé Pilots Project to Produce Low Carbon Fertilizer from Food Waste Streams,"Food and beverage giant Nestlé announced today the launch of a new pilot project aimed at producing low carbon fertilizer using cocoa shells, and addressing a major source of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.
Agriculture has emerged as a major focus area for climate action, as the sector accounts for a significant proportion of GHG emissions, and is among the most difficult areas to address climate impact. The sector contributes a significant proportion of the climate impact of the food and beverage sector, which in turn accounts for approximately a third of global GHG emissions.
Under the new UK-based project, Nestlé, one the world’s largest corporate cocoa consumers, will assess whether cocoa shells from a confectionery site in York can be used to create a low-carbon fertilizer. The two-year trial will evaluate the fertilizer’s performance on crop production, soil health and GHG emissions. If the project is successful, the company said that up to 7,000 tonnes of low-carbon fertilizer, roughly 25% the total used for the company’s UK wheat production, could be produced and offered to farmers in its UK wheat supply chain.
Nestlé announced a commitment in 2019 to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, and in 2020 the company published its “time bound plan” to reach its climate goals, which also include targets to achieve a 20% emissions reduction by 2025 and 50% by 2030.
95% of Nestlé’s GHG emissions come from the company’s value chain, including around two-thirds from sourcing ingredients, and only around 5% from its direct operations. One of the company’s key emissions reduction initiatives includes advancing regenerative agriculture and farming practices, such as improving soil health, integrating trees into livestock foraging areas, switching to organic fertilizers and increasing the ability of farmland to store carbon.
In addition to heling the company reach its climate goals, Nestlé said that increasing production of low carbon fertilizer can also provide farmers with a more sustainable product at a reliable price.
Matt Ryan, Regeneration Lead at Nestlé UK & Ireland, said:
“Farmers often find themselves to be among the first groups exposed to global issues, and these risks are then borne by the food system we all depend upon. We have to find ways to build more resilience into the system and optimizing our use of natural resources is a critical part of this. This project is a small, but very meaningful step towards a net zero future, where farmers, local enterprises, and nature all stand to benefit.”",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT,ESGTODAY

"September 12, 2023",Amazon Announces one of the Largest Ever DAC Carbon Removal Purchases,"Amazon announced today a 10-year agreement for the purchase of 250,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide removal credits with energy giant Occidental’s (Oxy) carbon capture platform 1PointFive. The announcement marks Amazon’s first investment in Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology, and one of the largest-ever orders for a DAC facility.
DAC technology, listed by the IEA as a key carbon removal tool in the transition to a net-zero energy system, extracts CO2 directly from the atmosphere for use as a raw material or permanently removed when combined with storage. According to the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change mitigation study released last year, scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C include carbon dioxide removal methods scaling to billions of tons of removal annually over the coming decades, with DAC positioned to potentially account for a significant portion of the total.
Amazon’s carbon dioxide removal (CDR) credits will be enabled by 1PointFive’s Texas-bases DAC plant STRATOS, which is currently under construction and expected to be commercially operational in 2025. When fully operational, Stratos is expected to capture 500,000 metric tons of CO2 annually, making it the world’s largest plant of its kind. As part of the agreement, the captured CO2 used for the CDR credits will be stored in saline reservoirs.
Michael Avery, President and General Manager of 1PointFive, said:
“The addition of 1PointFive’s high-integrity, quantifiable carbon removal credits support Amazon’s path to achieve net zero and shows the growing role that DAC technology will play in decarbonization pathways. We are excited to collaborate with Amazon to help them achieve their sustainability goals.”
The agreement follows the announcement last month that the South Texas DAC hub being developed by month that Oxy, DAC technology provider Carbon Engineering and engineering company Worley was selected by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to receive grants of up to $600 million, one of only two projects selected.
Oxy also announced an agreement last month to acquire Carbon Engineering, in a deal the company said would accelerate the deployment of Direct Air Capture “as a large-scale, cost effective, global carbon removal solution.”
Amazon also announced an investment by its Climate Pledge Fund in DAC technology company CarbonCapture. CarbonCapture is currently developing “Project Bison,” a new DAC project in Wyoming in partnership with carbon storage developer Frontier Carbon Solutions. The project is expected to be operational by late 2023, and to be developed over multiple phases through 2030, reaching 5 million tons of capture and storage annual capacity.
In addition to the investment, CarbonCapture will make up to 100,000 tons of carbon removal credits available to Amazon. Amazon said that it aims to make the credits available to businesses within the company as well as to suppliers, selling partners, and customers.
Adrian Corless, CarbonCapture’s CEO and Chief Technology Officer, said:
“We’re extremely excited to be backed by a first-class venture investor like Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund. Further, we’re looking forward to leveraging our relationship with Amazon to both democratize access and reduce the long-run cost of producing carbon removal credits.”
Amazon’s Climate Pledge fund is a venture investment program aimed at backing visionary companies developing products and services that facilitate the transition to a zero carbon economy. The $2 billion fund was established in June 2020, aiming to help Amazon and other companies achieve the goals outlined in The Climate Pledge, including reaching net zero carbon by 2040.
Kara Hurst, Vice President of Worldwide Sustainability at Amazon, said:
“Amazon’s primary focus is to decarbonize our global operations and reach net-zero carbon by 2040 through our transition to renewable energy, building with more sustainable materials and electrifying our delivery fleet and global logistics. These investments in direct air capture complement our emissions reductions plans and we are excited to support the growth and deployment of this technology.”",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT,ESGTODAY
"September 12, 2023",California Lawmakers Pass Bill Requiring Companies to Disclose Full Value Chain Emissions,"A new proposed California law that could require most large U.S. companies to disclose their full value chain greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions passed the state’s Assembly, with lawmakers on Monday passing the bill in a 41-20 vote, marking a major step towards the establishment of the mandatory emissions reporting bill into law.  
The bill will now return to the Senate, where it already passed in May, and from there to the desk of Governor Newsom for a final decision on its passage into law. The bill is similar to one introduced in California last year that passed in the state Senate, but was one vote short of passing on the Assembly.
In a social media post following the vote Senator Scott Wiener, who introduced the bill, SB 253, earlier this year, called the approval a “huge climate win,” adding that the proposed law “will make California a global leader in corporate carbon transparency.”
Huge climate win in California: Despite a massive misinformation campaign by opponents, the Assembly just passed our bill to require large corporations to be transparent about their carbon footprint.

SB 253 will make California a global leader in corporate carbon transparency.
— Senator Scott Wiener (@Scott_Wiener) September 12, 2023
The legislation would require companies with revenues greater than $1 billion that do business in California to report annually on their emissions from all scopes, including direct emissions (Scope 1), emissions from purchase and use of electricity (Scope 2), and indirect emissions, including those associated with supply chains, business travel, employee commuting, procurement, waste, and water usage (Scope 3).
Disclosure obligations would begin in 2026 for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and in 2027 for Scope 3 emissions, with measurement and reporting to be performed according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol standards. The law would also require companies to obtain third party assurance for their emissions reporting, starting with a limited assurance level beginning in 2026 for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and at a more stringent reasonable assurance level in 2030, and at a limited assurance level for Scope 3 in 2030.
The announcement comes as the SEC is preparing the final version of its own climate-related disclosure rules for U.S. companies, following the release of an initial proposal in March 2022. The California law would go farther in some ways than the proposed SEC rules, applying to all large companies, as opposed to only public companies, and including all Scope 3 emissions. The SEC’s initial proposal required reporting on Scope 3 emissions if they are material, or if the company has a stated emissions reduction goal that includes Scope 3, and earlier this year SEC Chair Gary Gensler said that the commission was considering some adjustments to its rules, including on the Scope 3 requirement, following feedback raising concerns about the high cost of providing these disclosures and concerns about the ability to provide accurate information.
The SEC’s rules will also likely face opposition from Republican lawmakers, who have argued against a climate disclosure requirement “in any form.”
Even if the SEC was unsuccessful in establishing mandatory climate-related reporting, however, the proposed California law could result in widespread emissions disclosure anyway. When introducing the bill in February, Wiener noted that the new reporting rules would apply to most large U.S. companies, as long as they operate in the California market. Additionally, many U.S. companies will have to comply with the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), for example which includes mandatory reporting obligations for large companies doing business in Europe.
Another bill, SB 261, is also slated for a vote in the Assembly this week, which would require companies to report on climate-related financial risk and the measures they have adopted to reduce and adapt to those risks.",ESG REPORTING/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY

I am delighted that the two new, fully electric MINI models – the MINI Cooper and MINI Aceman – are also being produced in Oxford, thereby confirming our path to a fully electric future. The continuing high demand for our locally emission-free vehicles shows the openness of the global MINI community to electromobility, which we will be able to serve optimally, also thanks to Oxford.”
The new investment follows BMW’s announcement in 2021 to expand company efforts to combat climate change, including goals to significantly reduce vehicle emissions throughout the lifecycle, reduce CO2 emissions by 40% per vehicle by 2030, and make a minimum of 50% of its global sales from battery electric vehicles by 2030.
Earlier this year, the company said that its goal to reach 50% global EV sales could be reached earlier than 2030.
The announcement marks a win for the UK’s Sunak government, which has set goals to establish itself as a hub for sustainable investment, but has come under fire for not sufficiently responding to the clean energy and industry packages launched by other major economies the U.S. and EU, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, and the Green Industrial Plan, in order to attract large-scale investment. Investor groups have warned that the government’s recent policy signals have reduced confidence in the its commitments to its climate policies have put the UK’s position in the race for green investment at risk.
BMW said that the government supported the company’s announced investment, which it added “will help to secure jobs at the Oxford manufacturing plant and at the body-pressing facility in Swindon.”
Prime Minister Sunak welcomed the investment, calling it “a major vote of confidence in our car sector which will support high-quality jobs and grow our economy” in a social media post following the announcement.
The Mini is a British classic.

So it’s fantastic to see @BMWGroup backing its future here with a £600 million investment 🚀

This is a major vote of confidence in our car sector which will support high-quality jobs and grow our economy.https://t.co/38EdCEeq2F

"September 11, 2023",Guest Post: Responsible ITAD & E-Waste Recycling is a Fast Track to Achieving ESG and Circular Economy Goals for Any Business,"By John Shegerian, Chairman and CEO of ERI
One of the lesser-known strategy for companies to attain their ESG and decarbonization targets is the responsible recycling of electronic waste.
E-waste is the fastest growing solid waste stream on the planet — by a margin of 2 to 4 times the speed of the second fastest growing stream. Spurred by increasing consumer demand for the newest technologies and the shortening life spans of many devices, e-waste is piling up in landfills both domestically and abroad. Despite the steady increase in the amount of e-waste being generated each year, a mere 17% is being responsibly recycled.
The straightforward solution: enterprises and all types should explore the responsible recycling of their e-waste. By realizing the potential of responsible ITAD and e-waste recycling disposal, businesses can make significant strides towards fulfilling their ESG goals and circular economy ambitions.
A Circular Economy
Through the recycling of e-waste, businesses can substantially mitigate their ecological impact and align with the “E” in ESG. E-waste frequently contains hazardous materials and valuable resources, underscoring the importance of appropriate disposal and resource reclamation.
Embracing responsible e-waste recycling can be a significant step towards realizing circular economy goals. Rather than perpetuating the linear “take, make, dispose” model, a circular economy minimizes waste, conserve resources, and promote sustainable product lifecycles. By ensuring that discarded electronic devices are recycled and reintegrated into the production cycle, businesses contribute to a more sustainable and efficient economic model.
Electronic devices are a perfect entry point into the circular economy. To make a tablet or cellphone, you have a metal or plastic case, computer components, wires, etc. Metals such as copper, iron, silver, lead, tin, and aluminum are typically mined from the earth and then used in manufacturing to create components required for new devices.
By working with an e-waste recycling or ITAD company that is transparent and able to track all materials from each device processed, an opportunity is created for businesses to not only do the right thing for the planet, but also demonstrate their impactful efforts via ESG or sustainability reports. 
A Distinct Advantage for Businesses
E-waste recycling also offers tangible business advantages. It enhances brand reputation and constituent trust. Consumers today value businesses that demonstrate a commitment to sustainability. By responsibly managing e-waste, businesses position themselves as responsible corporate citizens and environmental stewards.
Extracting valuable materials from recycled electronics also reduces the need for purchasing virgin resources, resulting in potential cost efficiencies.
In short, responsible e-waste recycling is a direct stride toward achieving ESG objectives and fostering a circular economy. By harnessing the environmental, social, and business advantages of appropriate e-waste disposal, a company of any size can make significant progress in the effort to reduce its environmental footprint, conserve resources, and enhance its reputation.
Incorporating responsible e-waste recycling into an ESG strategy is an easy win that literally is in the palms of all of our hands.

"September 11, 2023",G20 Targets Tripling of Global Renewable Energy Capacity by 2030,"G20 leaders announced an agreement to target tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030, and to cooperate on the development of clean energy technologies at a two-day summit hosted over the weekend in New Delhi, although the meetings’ results fell short of developed markets’ participants ambitions to accelerate and strengthen global emissions reduction commitments.
The G20 members include Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Türkiye, the UK, the U.S. and the European Union. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping did not attend the conference, sending Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Premier Li Qiang, respectively, in their places.
The summit, convened under the theme “One Earth · One Family · One Future,” covered a wide range of topics, including Russia’s war in Ukraine and its impact on food and energy security, economic growth, progress on the Sustainable Development Goals, and climate and the environment, among other issues.
In a communique released Saturday, the G20 New Delhi Leaders’ Declaration, the leaders noted a significant lack of progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The UN SDGs refer to the 17 categories of goals adopted as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with the aim to protect the planet and improve the quality of life globally, with targets such as ending poverty and hunger, improving education, and protecting the environment.
The declaration said:
“At the midway point to 2030, the global progress on SDGs is off-track with only 12 percent of the targets on track.”
Among the key commitments listed in the declaration were pledges to “Accelerate the full and effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” “Pursue low-GHG/low-carbon emissions, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable development pathways,” “Accelerate efforts and enhance resources towards achieving the Paris Agreement, including its temperature goal,” and to “Scale up financing from all sources for accelerating progress on SDGs.”
According to media reports prior to the meeting, G7 leaders were pushing for commitments to accelerate reaching net zero ahead of 2050 and set more ambitious interim emissions reduction targets, as well as adopting stronger language on reducing fossil fuel use and financing, while oil-producing countries, and those more heavily dependent on coal-based power, including Russia, China, Saudi Arabia and India, were opposed to some of the proposals.
While the declaration included pledges to “pursue and encourage efforts to triple renewable energy capacity globally,” and “accelerating efforts towards phasedown of unabated coal power, in line with national circumstances,” reductions in overall fossil fuels were not included, with the text mentioning only a prior commitment “to phase-out and rationalise, over the medium term, inefficient fossil fuel subsidies,” and reiterating the existing pledge to “achieve global net zero GHG emissions/carbon neutrality by or around mid-century.”
On the sidelines of the summit, leaders of India, the U.S., Singapore, Bangladesh, Italy, Brazil, Argentina, Mauritius and UAE announced the launch of the Global Biofuel Alliance (GBA), aimed at accelerating the global uptake of biofuels through the facilitation of technology advancements and the utilization of sustainable biofuels, and by supporting the development of standards and certification. Biofuels are expected to play a critical role in the transition to cleaner energy sources, particularly for sectors in which energy solutions such as wind or solar are less practical.",ENERGY TRANSITION/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY
"September 8, 2023",IKEA Parent Ingka Launches its First Battery Storage Project to Support Clean Energy Goals,"IKEA parent Ingka Group’s investment arm, Ingka Investments, announced the launch of Cameron Storage, its first-ever battery storage project, in partnership with renewable energy company Apex Clean Storage.
According to the companies, the 16.4 MW project, co-located with Ingka’s 165 MW Cameron Wind Farm in Cameron County, Texas, will support the Texas power grid with increased reliability amid energy supply and demand fluctuations. The project is anticipated to begin commercial operations in October.
Energy storage solutions are emerging as a key energy transition investment area. Storage forms one of the major building blocks for the rapidly expanding clean energy transition, given the intermittent generating nature of many sources of renewable energy, such as wind and solar, and the need to satisfy round-the-clock energy demand, while ensuring that energy is not wasted.
Apex Clean Energy CEO Ken Young said:
“For more than a decade, IKEA has charted the course for the corporate sector in investing in clean energy solutions, and today, Cameron Storage builds on that record of leadership. Utility-scale energy storage unlocks the full potential of clean power to decarbonize our economy while providing increased reliability and certainty for our electric grid.”
The new project follows a commitment by Ingka Investments in 2021 to expand its investments in renewable energy to €6.5 billion by 2030. Ingka has already invested and committed over €3.5 billion in renewables since 2009, and currently owns and manages 575 wind turbines across 17 countries, 20 solar parks, and 935,000 solar panels on the roofs of IKEA stores and warehouses, with total capacity of more than 2.3 GW.
The company added that the new project forms part of its commitment to help achieve IKEA’s commitment to become climate positive, reducing more greenhouse gas emissions than its value chain emits, by 2030.
Ingka Investments Managing Director Peter van der Poel said:
“This is an important step in our journey towards becoming climate positive. Going forward we aim to invest in a mix of wind, solar and energy storage. Investing in all three technologies will help to provide renewable energy during more hours of the year and optimize the use of our grid connections.”",COMPANIES/ ENERGY TRANSITION,ESGTODAY
"September 8, 2023",Apple Backs California’s Proposed Emissions Reporting Rules,"Tech giant Apple has expressed its support for proposed legislation in California that would require most large U.S. companies to disclose their full value chain greenhouse gas emissions, according to a letter the company sent to state Senator Scott Wiener.
The legislation, California Senate Bill 253 (SB 253), introduced by Wiener earlier this year, would require companies with revenues greater than $1 billion that do business in California to report annually on their emissions from all scopes, including direct emissions (Scope 1), emissions from purchase and use of electricity (Scope 2), and indirect emissions, including those associated with supply chains, business travel, employee commuting, procurement, waste, and water usage (Scope 3).
Disclosure obligations would begin in 2026 for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and in 2027 for Scope 3 emissions, with measurement and reporting to be performed according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol standards.
When he introduced the bill, Wiener noted that the new reporting rules would apply to most large U.S. companies. While the SEC is also in the process of setting its own climate-related reporting obligations for companies, the California proposals go beyond the SEC rules in some ways, with more comprehensive Scope 3 reporting requirements, and application to all large companies, not just public companies.
The bill passed in the state Senate in May, and is currently in the Assembly, where it has been ordered to its third reading.
Apple has been a long-time proponent of mandatory climate disclosure, including publicly calling on the SEC in 2021 to introduce rules requiring consistent, audited emissions reporting. In 2022, the company announced that it will require companies in its supply chain to report on progress towards achieving carbon neutrality, including on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reductions related to Apple production.
In its letter to Senator Wiener, Apple said:
“We’re strongly supportive of climate disclosures to improve transparency and drive progress in the flight against climate change, and we’re grateful for your leadership to drive comprehensive emissions disclosure.”
The letter specifically commended certain aspects of the bill, including the requirement to report Scope 3 emissions, which the company said “are essential to understanding the full range of a company’s climate impacts,” the requirement for third party assurance, and the bill’s provisions to harmonize its rules with other emerging climate reporting regimes to avoid duplicate reporting and assurance.
Apple’s letter also included recommendations for California’s proposed rules, including allowing for the consideration of the use of internationally recognized reporting standards beyond the GHG Protocol, and more frequent review of the standards that can be used than the bill’s proposed 5-year review process.
The letter added:
“Your bill would encourage others to speed up their efforts towards carbon neutrality, and push them to work with their supply chains, just as Apple is doing. We thank you for your efforts to maintain California as a leader in fighting climate change.”",COMPANIES/ ESG REPORTING/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY

"September 7, 2023",Microsoft Signs One of the Largest-Ever Permanent Carbon Removal Deals,"Microsoft announced today that it has signed a multi-year deal for the removal of up to 315,000 metric tons of CO2 with Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology company Heirloom, marking one of the largest carbon removal agreements to date.
DAC technology, listed by the IEA as a key carbon removal option in the transition to a net-zero energy system, extracts CO2 directly from the atmosphere for use as a raw material or permanently removed when combined with storage. According to the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change mitigation study released last year, scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C include carbon dioxide removal methods scaling to billions of tons of removal annually over the coming decades, with DAC positioned to potentially account for a significant portion of the total.
Heirloom, alongside partners Battelle and Climeworks, is currently developing the Louisiana-based Project Cypress, a DAC hub expected to be capable of capturing more than 1 million metric tons of CO2 annually from the atmosphere for permanent deep underground storage, more than 250 times the capacity of the largest DAC facility currently operating.
The agreement with Microsoft follows the announcement last month that Project Cypress was selected by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to receive grants of up to $600 million, one of only two projects selected.
Most solutions that capture and store CO2 are early stage and currently limited in scale, including DAC. The new deal signed with Microsoft will enable a new funding mechanism for Heirloom for its DAC development, as one of the first CO2 removal agreements to use a bankable mechanism that funds the project with future project cash flows, similar to structures used for large-scale infrastructure development agreements.
Heirloom CEO Shashank Samala said:
“Microsoft has been an incredible supporter of Heirloom, helping us scale one of the world’s most cost-effective Direct Air Capture solutions. Bankable agreements of this magnitude enable Heirloom to raise project finance for our rapid scale-up, fueling exponential growth like what we’ve seen in the renewable energy industry.”
The new agreement marks the latest in a series of recent carbon removal deals for Microsoft, forming part of the company’s initiative to become carbon negative by 2030, and to remove all of its historical emissions by 2050. Microsoft recently announced DAC-based agreements with climate tech company CarbonCapture and with startup Climeworks, and in March the company entered its first agreement for ocean-based carbon dioxide removal, with ocean health company Running Tide. Most recently, Microsoft announced an agreement for the purchase of 2.76 million tonnes of carbon removal with Danish energy provider Ørsted to capture and store biogenic carbon – emissions resulting from the combustion of biomass – generated at a wood chip-fired power station in Denmark over 11 years.
Microsoft announced an investment last year in Heirloom, as part of the DAC company’s $53 million Series A funding round.
Microsoft Senior Director of Energy and Carbon Brian Marrs said:
“Microsoft’s agreement with Heirloom is another important step in helping build the market for high-quality carbon removal and supports our path to become carbon negative by 2030. As an investor in and customer of Heirloom, we believe that Heirloom’s technical approach and plan are designed for rapid iteration to help drive down the cost of large-scale Direct Air Capture at the urgent pace needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.”",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT,ESGTODAY

"September 7, 2023",ECB Stress Test: Banks’ Credit Risk Doubles by 2030 Under Slower Climate Transition,"Banks, businesses and households would benefit from lower costs and reduced financial risks by the end of the decade if actions to reduce emissions were substantially accelerated, according new climate stress test results released by the European Central Bank’s (ECB), which found that banks’ credit risk could rise by more than 100% by 2030 if initiatives to hit global climate goals are pushed off to the second half of the decade.
The ECB’s findings were published with the results of its second economy-wide climate stress test, following the first stress test in 2021, aimed at assessing the impact of various climate transition pathways on companies, households, and financial institutions in the Euro area.
For the new stress test, the ECB considered three climate transition scenarios, including an “accelerated transition,” which frontloads green investments immediately in order to achieve emissions reductions by 2030 necessary to achieve the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature increase to +1.5ºC; a “late-push transition,” which still achieves the Paris Agreement goals, but delays an increase in action until after 2025, and; a “delayed transition,” compatible with a temperature increase of around +2.5ºC by the end of the century.
The accelerated transition scenario assumes a significant increase in energy costs in the near term, and substantially greater initial green investments, rising to €2 trillion by 2025, compared to only €0.5 trillion in the other.
Despite the higher initial costs, however, the stress test found that the “accelerated” transition scenario resulted in the lowest financial risk and lowest physical risk in the long-term, with the “late-push” scenario resulting in the most severe medium term impact on costs and risk, and the “delayed” scenario leading to much higher long-term physical risk from climate hazards.
For households, the accelerated scenario shows a rapid increase in energy expenses and investment, compared to slower growth under the other scenario, as near-term investments are made in renewable energy and energy efficiency, resulting in increased near-term credit risk, with higher debt levels incurred to cover the investments. Energy costs under the other scenarios surpass the accelerated scenario in 2025, however, peaking around 2028 under the late-push scenario, and continuing to rise beyond 2030 in the delayed scenario. By 2030, the accelerated and late-push scenarios find household discretionary income rising by between 10% – 12%, compared to only half as much under the delayed scenario.
For businesses, while renewable capacity levels in 2030 would be similar under the first two scenarios, overall cumulative investments in areas such as renewable energy and carbon mitigation would be higher under the late-push scenario, and firms would be at higher risk under this scenario as well, as the catch-up in green investments would need to increase swiftly from 2026. These risks would be particularly acute for companies in energy-intensive sectors such as manufacturing, mining and electricity. While credit risk levels were found to be similar in 2030 under the accelerated and delayed scenarios, they are also forecast to be moving in opposite directions, with credit risks on the way down under the accelerated scenario, and heading higher beyond 2030 under the delayed transition.
The impact on banks’ businesses would largely be a result of the transition effects on the companies and households which they loan to. The stress test results estimated banks’ credit risk rising by more than 100% by 2030 under the late-push scenario, compared to around 60% under the other scenarios, while credit risk is expected to be trending up in 2030 only under the delayed scenario, with “substantially different” long-term risk implications for the delayed transition.
ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said:
“Procrastinating may be easier and less costly today, but means we will pay a higher price tomorrow: the damage to our environment and economies from rising temperatures will be much more severe. In fact, the sooner and faster we complete the necessary green transition, the lower the overall costs and risks. This is one of the main outcomes of our second economy-wide climate stress test.”

"September 7, 2023",H2 Green Steel Raises Over $1.5 Billion to Build First-Ever Large Scale Green Steel Plant,"Decarbonized steel startup H2 Green Steel announced today that it has raised €1.5 billion in equity, with proceeds used to finance the construction of the world’s first large-scale green steel plant, capable of producing steel with 95% lower emissions than traditional blast furnace technology.
The deal marks the largest private placement in Europe this year, and comes as demand for low carbon steel is expected to increase significantly, over the next several years, as manufacturers globally aim to decarbonize their supply chains.
Steelmaking is one of the biggest emitters of CO2 globally, and one of the more challenging sectors to abate, with total greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the sector accounting for 7% – 9% of direct emissions from the global use of fossil fuels.
Founded in 2020, H2 Green Steel is developing its flagship green steel plant in Boden, Sweden, with the project including a giga-scale green hydrogen plant as an integrated part of the steel production facility. The company employs hydrogen produced using green power to remove the oxygen from iron oxide, avoiding most of the CO2 emissions normally produced, and uses electricity from 100% renewable sources for the energy requirements generated in the manufacturing process. H2 Green Steel aims to begin production in 2025, with plans to produce 5 million tons of nearly fossil-free steel by 2030.
The company has announced supply agreements with companies including Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Scania, and global auto supplier ZF.
Otto Gernandt, CFO of H2 Green Steel, said:
“This marks the start of industrial scale decarbonization of basic materials production. The sector will require substantial investments over the coming decades to enable our customers to produce green end products and, thereby meet their climate targets. We hope this financing will contribute towards accelerating the much needed, broad participation of capital markets in the transformation of hard-to-abate industries.”
The private placement was led by new investor Hy24, together with existing investors Altor, GIC and Just Climate, and included participation from new investors Andra AP - fonden and Temasek, and existing investors including AMF, Cristina Stenbeck, Hitachi Energy, IMAS Foundation, Kinnevik, Schaeffler, Vargas and Wallenberg Investments holding company FAM. 
Hy24 recently raised €2 billion for its hydrogen impact fund, Clean H2 Infra Fund, making it the world’s largest infrastructure fund to exclusively invest in the clean hydrogen value chain. The company’s investment in H2 Green Steel is the largest by its hydrogen infrastructure fund so far.
Pierre-Etienne Franc, CEO of Hy24, said:
”H2 Green Steel Boden is the most advanced large-scale, green industrial project in the world. It is a trailblazer in decarbonization of hard-to-abate industrial sectors like steel. The investment by Hy24’s clean hydrogen infrastructure fund will support the H2 Green Steel’s ambition to materially reshape steel markets, providing a green alternative to its off-takers and partners. This is part of Hy24’s commitment to help industry get to net zero.”

"September 6, 2023",Green Steel Startup Boston Metal Raises $262 Million,"Metals technology company Boston Metals announced today that it has raised $262 million at the close of its Series C fundraising, with proceeds from the financing to be used to accelerate its platform enabling decarbonized steelmaking. The company announced the first close of the funding round in January at $120 million.
Demand for fossil-free steel is expected to increase significantly, as manufacturers globally aim to decarbonize their supply chains. Steelmaking is one of the biggest emitters of CO2 globally, with total greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the sector accounting for 7% – 9% of direct emissions from the global use of fossil fuels.
Founded in 2013, Boston Metals is commercializing Molten Oxide Electrolysis (MOE), an electricity-powered metals production platform that can be used for green steel, as well as for high-value metals such as tin and niobium. The one-step technology uses renewable electricity to convert all iron ore grades into steel through an energy-efficient process, and selectively extracts valuable metals from complex, low-concentration materials that are currently considered waste, resulting in a process that produces zero CO2 emissions, has no need for process water, hazardous chemicals, or precious-metal catalysts, and is cost competitive compared to traditional production methods. The company opened a subsidiary in Brazil in 2022 to use its MOE platform to build a high-value metals platform helping miners recover value from mining waste.
Following the financing, Boston Metal said that it will accelerate the deployment of its high-value metals business, grow its team globally, and commercially demonstrate its MOE platform. The company is on track to ship its first high-value metals in 2024 and bring its MOE technology to the steel market by 2026.
Tadeu Carneiro, Chairman and CEO of Boston Metal, said:
“Our high-value metals business is nearing commercialization at our subsidiary in Brazil, with our manufacturing facility opening this fall, and we continue to make significant progress on the scale-up of MOE for green steel production at our pilot plant outside of Boston.”
New investors in the close of the Series C fundraising included Aramco Ventures, M&G Investments, Baillie Gifford, and natural resource investment firm Goehring & Rozencwajg. Additional investors included Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund, BHP Ventures and Prelude Ventures.
Jim Sledzik, Managing Director, North America at Aramco Ventures, said:
“This investment in Boston Metal will help foster the innovation and collaboration required to address climate challenges. Green steel solutions, like Boston Metal’s, have the potential to tackle emissions in one of the most difficult-to-abate industries, and we believe the company has the leadership, technology and strategy necessary to meet this opportunity.”",ENERGY TRANSITION/ PRIVATE EQUITY,ESGTODAY
"September 6, 2023",Amazon Signs Deal for Low Carbon Shipping with Maersk,"Integrated container logistics company A.P. Moller – Maersk and Amazon announced today an agreement for ocean shipping utilizing low to very low GHG emissions biofuels in place of fossil fuels.
The new 2023-2024 agreement includes transport of 20,000 FFE containers using green biofuels, which will result in an estimated 44,600 metric tons of CO2e emissions reduction, according to the companies, equivalent to 50 million pounds of coal burned.
Amazon has set a goal to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040 across its value chain. Scope 3 emissions, or those originating in the company’s value chain outside of its direct control, account for over three quarters of Amazon’s emissions footprint. In the company’s recently released sustainability report, Amazon revealed that it succeeded in reducing its Scope 3 emissions by 0.7% in 2022 despite growing revenues by 9%, with emissions cuts driven by areas including building construction, leased buildings and equipment and third-party transportation.
Adam Baker, Vice President of Global Transportation at Amazon, said:
“We’re proud to collaborate with Maersk, a Climate Pledge signatory and leader in shipping logistics, on actionable solutions to decarbonize maritime shipping, We’re excited to have containers on Maersk’s first methanol-enabled feeder vessel and to continue using their biofuel.”
The agreement was made through Maersk’s ECO Delivery program, an offering that allows shippers to replace fossil fuels with green fuels, enabling direct emissions savings, and providing audited CO2 savings and 3rd party verification. According to the companies, Amazon and Maersk have now arranged container shipping using low GHG fuel options for four consecutive years, with the program this year adding the use of green methanol, in addition to biodiesel produced from waste streams.
Maersk has announced a series of moves to expand its low carbon fleet, with 25 methanol-enabled vessels on order, beginning with its order in 2021 for the world’s first carbon-neutral methanol fueled container ship. Earlier this year, the company announced plans for the industry’s first-ever retrofit to convert an existing fossil fuel-powered container vessel to dual-fuel methanol-powered vessel, with plans to retrofit future vessels. The company has announced a series of carbon reduction targets, including goals to achieve net zero gas emissions in 2040 across its entire businesses and all scopes, as well as a 50% reduction in emissions per transported container in its ocean fleet, and a 70% reduction in absolute emissions from fully controlled terminals by 2030.
Narin Phol, President North America at A.P. Moller – Maersk, said:
“Amazon’s record of securing sustainable shipping over the years, no matter the business climate, is testament to its contributions to building a better future. We share a common goal with Amazon to reduce our total GHG emissions to net zero by 2040. As cosigners of the Climate Pledge, we must constantly create new opportunities to make this a decade of action. Decarbonizing shipping is one significant step that is to be combined with many others to protect our future.”",COMPANIES/ ENERGY TRANSITION,ESGTODAY

"September 6, 2023",Fidelity International Adds 6 Article 9 Funds to Sustainable Investment Lineup,"Investment management firm Fidelity International announced today the launch of two new funds classified as Article 9 under the EU’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).
Along with the reclassification of four additional funds from the less stringent Article 8 category to Article 9, the announcement marks a significant expansion of Fidelity’s Article 9 offerings to 8 funds.
The EU SFDR regulation includes classification levels for sustainability-focused investment funds, including ‘Article 8’ funds that “promote environmental or social characteristics or a combination of those characteristics,” and the more stringent ‘Article 9’ funds, “which have sustainable investment as their objective.”
Fidelity’s Article 9 fund expansion follows moves last year by several asset managers to reclassify funds from Article 9 to Article 8, due to uncertainty at the time surrounding the new regulation’s compliance requirements, particularly the determination of what is considered “sustainable.”
In a statement announcing the expansion of the Article 9 funds range, Fidelity said that the move will “address the growing client demand for strategies which invest in issuers that contribute to and benefit from the transition to a more sustainable economy.”
Jenn-Hui Tan, Chief Sustainability Officer, Fidelity International, said:
“These funds are supported by the further enhancement of Fidelity’s sustainable investing framework, including a proprietary dataset which assesses an issuer’s positive contribution to the targets and indicators of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (“SDG”). From this foundation, we have been able to develop a series of fund solutions for clients wishing to align their investments with the transition to a sustainable economy.”
The new active funds include the Sustainable Global Equity Fund, which will be managed by Cornelia Furse as lead Portfolio Manager, and the Sustainable Asian Focus Fund, managed by Mohit Mandhana. The reclassified funds include the Sustainable Biodiversity Fund, Sustainable Climate Solutions Fund, Sustainable Eurozone Equity Fund, and Sustainable US Equity Fund.
According to Fidelity, in order to align with its Article 9 classification, each fund will have 100% of investments invested in ‘sustainable investments,’ based on a sustainable investment definition of having at least 50% of revenues generated from activities contributing to an environmental or social objective according to the EU Taxonomy, Fidelity’s proprietary SDG tool, or a robust strategy to decarbonize towards net zero. Investments are also required to do no significant harm, meet minimum safeguards, and have good governance practices.
Christophe Gloser, Head of Sales, Continental Europe, Fidelity International added:
“Sustainability is one of the biggest and most disruptive megatrends that the sector is facing and one that is impacting our investment decision process. We are committed to providing the best solutions for our clients which is why we strive to further develop relevant products for our clients in the long-term.”",INVESTORS/ NEW FUNDS & PRODUCTS,ESGTODAY
"September 6, 2023",Less than 5% of Banks Have Set Net Zero Commitments Across all Financing Categories: TPI Report,"Banks are increasingly setting goals to reduce the climate impact of their financing activities, and are improving in areas including the disclosure of financed emissions and governance of climate risk, although significant gaps remain, with less than 5% of banks disclosing a net zero target covering all financing activities, according to a new analysis released by the Transition Pathway Initiative’s (TPI) Global Climate Transition Centre.
Founded in 2017, the Transition Pathway Initiative is a global initiative led by asset owners and supported by asset managers that assesses companies’ preparedness for the transition to a low-carbon economy and supports efforts to address climate change. The TPI Centre was established in 2022 at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment to provide research and data on the progress of the financial and corporate world in transitioning to a low-carbon economy.
Financing activities typically accounts for the vast majority of financial institutions’ climate impact, with financed emissions often hundreds of times greater than operational emissions. For the study, the TPI Centre assessed 26 of the world’s largest global banks according to its recently released Net Zero Banking Assessment Framework, which considers a wide range of indicators from banks’ net zero commitments and targets to their disclosure, climate risk governance and climate solutions financing.
The report found that banks have made significant progress towards the integration of climate change into their business strategies, with a significant majority of banks having a net zero financed emissions target in place, and most introducing emissions reduction goals for carbon-intensive sectors. While banks’ climate-focused actions have improved, however, the report also indicated significant room for progress for banks to align their strategies and financing activities with global climate goals.
While 20 of the 26 banks (77%) have disclosed a commitment to net zero financed emissions by 2050, for example, only half of those banks have disclosed which on- and off-balance sheet activities – which include lending, capital markets activity, investment banking, asset management, and advisory activities – are included in those commitments, and only one of the banks has actually disclosed a commitment covering all on- and off-balance sheet activities.
Similarly, while the report found a significant increase in the number of banks setting medium-terms decarbonization targets for high-emitting sectors, with 85% of banks having at least some sector targets in place, up from 33% in a prior 2022 study, only around a third of oil & gas sector targets, and less than half of electric utility sector targets were found to be aligned with the goal of limiting global temperature increase to 1.5°C. Additionally, none of the banks had set targets for high-emitting sectors including food, diversified mining, paper and chemicals.
The banks’ sectoral target setting also does not appear to have been widely incorporated yet into strategy, with only 6 of the banks found to have set financing conditions, such as a requirement for clients to have transition plans in place, to their financed emissions reduction targets.
The report found significant progress in banks’ climate-related disclosure practices, with 69% of banks now disclosing absolute financed emissions for at least one sector, compared with only 33% in 2022, although only 3 banks disclosed absolute financed emissions for all high-emitting sectors, and none of the banks’ disclosures covering all on- and off-balance sheet activities. Additionally, while 17 of the banks have included climate risks as a key risk category in their disclosure, only 8 of the banks have disclosed the scenario analysis results for physical climate risks, and 6 for transition risks.
The report also examined the banks’ sustainable financing activities, indicating that nearly 70% of the banks have set targets to increase financing directed towards climate solutions, although details regarding these targets are often unclear, with only 5 banks disclosing a definition of “climate solutions” based on an external standard, and none of the banks disclosing the total share of finance directed towards climate solutions in the last year.
In the report, the TPI Centre said:
“Our 2023 assessment reveals an overall improvement in banks’ climate action compared with last year. In particular, more banks have been setting emission reduction targets and extending the sectoral coverage of those targets. Following this target-setting, some banks are then defining financing policies to direct capital towards less carbon-intensive companies and industries.
“While this progress is encouraging, important work remains to be done for climate-related matters to be systematically embedded in decision-making across all banking activities.”

According to Google, the new agreement will help the company achieve 60% carbon-free energy in its offices and data centers in Ireland in 2025. The new agreement will also enable the construction of the Tullabeg Solar Farm, which will provide new-to-the-grid capacity.
In a blog post announcing the financing, Ainhoa Anda, Data Center Energy Senior Lead, Google, said:
“In addition to contributing to decarbonizing Google’s services, renewable projects like this one help Ireland to achieve its own renewable energy targets. The Irish Government’s Climate Action Plan aims to meet 80% of the national electricity demand with renewable energy. It also sets a sub-target for corporate electricity consumers, that 15% of the country’s electricity demand by 2030 should be met through corporate PPAs. This project brings Ireland closer to reaching these goals.”
According to Google, the new agreement will contribute to its commitment to power all its operations on 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) by 2030. Google parent Alphabet announced a 24/7 CFE ambition in 2020, aiming to run its entire business on carbon-free energy by 2030. Operating on 24/7 CFE means matching electricity demand with CFE supply every hour of every day, in every region where the company operates.
The agreement marks the latest in a series of renewable energy announcements by Google, including a 189 MW PPA last month with Apex Clean Energy, a 15-year 150 MW PPA in April with Ørsted, and a collaboration launched in March with renewable transaction infrastructure provider LevelTen Energy to provide a faster and easier RFP process for PPAs, speeding up the time to negotiate and execute deals by around 80%.

"September 5, 2023",Guest Post – Due Diligence: A Core Concept Underpinning the CSRD Framework,"By: Reinhilde Weidacher, Managing Director, Head of EMEA Solutions, ISS Corporate Solutions
The European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), adopted at the end of July, require companies to comprehensively report on their due diligence processes under the four pillars of governance; strategy; impact, risk and opportunities; metrics and targets. This covers how companies embed due diligence in governance, strategy and business models, engage with affected stakeholders, identify and assess negative impacts on people and the environment, take action to address those impacts and track the effectiveness of these effort. At the same time, the ESRS don’t impose specific sustainability due diligence obligations.
Why Do Due Diligence Procedures Assume Such a Central Role?
3% of monitored companies[1] have faced grievances during the past 12 months over alleged negative human rights and environmental impacts at their operations or along their supply chains. A company’s ability to prevent such issues and, where that fails, respond to these grievances in a timely and relevant manner is paramount for sustainable economic development and is critical for the success of a business.
Investors are paying close attention. Under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) they have to disclose a Statement on principal adverse impacts (PAIs) of investment decisions on sustainability factors. Mandatory indicators include the share of investments in companies that have been involved in violations of the UNGC principles or OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, as well as the share of investments in companies without policies to monitor compliance with those standards and/or mechanisms to handle grievances or complaints regarding possible violations.
The concept of sustainability due diligence sets out procedures aimed at preventing and mitigating adverse impacts of business activities. It has been developed and refined through extensive stakeholder consultations since the early 2000s. The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights are a set of 31 principles organized under a 3-pillar framework: protect, respect and remedy. They were adopted by the UN Human Rights Council in 2011 and have since been widely endorsed by governments, NGOs and business. The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises are recommendations for responsible business conduct adhered to by 51 governments.
What is the Status of Endorsement of these Frameworks?
Endorsement of these frameworks varies widely between regions and industries, with Europe showing the highest level of support for the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UN GPs) and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (OECD GLs).

"September 5, 2023","EFRAG, GRI Confirm High Interoperability of European Sustainability Reporting Rules and GRI Standards, Avoiding Double Reporting Concerns","The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) announced today the release of a statement confirming that they have achieved a high level of interoperability between the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) and the GRI Standards.
The high interoperability achievement will significantly reduce the sustainability disclosure burden for many companies, largely eliminating the prospect of “double reporting,” or the need to disclose sustainability-related information according to two sets of separate standards.
Hans Buysse, EFRAG Administrative Board President said:
“This joint statement concludes several years of diligent work towards a high level of interoperability between the ESRS and GRI standards. The efforts made by the GRI and EFRAG Sustainability Reporting teams will prevent the need for double reporting by companies resulting in a user-friendly reporting system without undue complexity. Our collaboration with GRI is bearing fruit and we are already preparing ourselves for the next challenges in the field of sustainability reporting.”
The ESRS, developed by EFRAG, and officially adopted by the European Commission in July, set out the rules and requirements for companies to report on sustainability-related impacts, opportunities and risks under the EU’s upcoming Corporate Sustainable Reporting Directive (CSRD). The CSRD, on track to begin applying from the beginning of 2024, will significantly expand the number of companies required to provide sustainability disclosures to over 50,000 from around 12,000 currently, and introduce more detailed reporting requirements on company impacts on the environment, human rights and social standards and sustainability-related risk.
GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards are one of the most commonly accepted global standards for sustainability reporting by companies, developed to enable consistent reporting across companies and industries, providing clearer communication to stakeholders regarding sustainability matters. The GRI published a major update of the standards in 2021.
The new statement follows the announcement by the GRI and EFRAG in 2021 of a cooperation agreement for the development of EU sustainability reporting standards and supporting convergence with global standards.
Carol Adams, Chair of the Global Sustainability Standards Board (GSSB), the independent body that sets the GRI standards, said:
“Since the early stages, we have actively engaged with EFRAG in the development of the ESRS. With this high level of interoperability achieved, we have now turned our attention to developing a detailed mapping of the disclosures from both sets of standards and technical guidance, which will help companies that report using GRI Standards prepare for CSRD requirements.”
One of the key areas of alignment highlighted between the standards is the requirement to adopt a double materiality approach, or disclosing information about how sustainability issues impact companies, as well as on companies’ impact on society and the environment.
According to the statement, with the double materiality approach in place, and the CSRD’s requirement to take account of existing standards, “ESRS and GRI definitions, concepts and disclosures regarding impacts are fully or, when full alignment was not possible due to the content of the CSRD mandate, closely aligned.”
The organizations added that with the high level of interoperability achieved, companies already reporting under the GRI will be well prepared for ESRS reporting, and that those “reporting under ESRS are considered as reporting with reference to the GRI Standards.”
Eelco van der Enden, CEO of GRI, said:
“This is great news for businesses and for GRI reporters. They can use their current reporting practices to prepare for the new requirements under ESRS. What is more, ESRS reporters are considered as reporting with reference to the GRI Standards and have the possibility to report on additional topics not covered by the ESRS in accordance with GRI Standards. GRI is fully committed to actively engage with EFRAG and other standards setters to reduce the reporting burden for companies.”",ESG REPORTING,ESGTODAY

The survey found that 92% of executives are projecting increasing their spending on ESG data by at least 10% year-over-year, including more than half that expect to increase spending by at least 20%, and 18% who expect ESG data spending to grow by 50% or more this year.
The plans to increase spending comes as most executives view ESG data as a key competitive factor, with 45% of respondents reporting that access to ESG data is “table stakes” to keeping up with competitors’ capabilities, and 44% saying that ESG data is critical to their firms’ competitive differentiation. An additional 10% reported that their organizations use ESG data primarily for regulatory compliance, and only 1% said that ESG data was not very important for their product or marketing strategy.
Interestingly, nearly two thirds (64%) of respondents to the survey reported that they considered themselves to be ahead of their competitors in terms of ESG capabilities, while 28% saw themselves as behind.
Leila Sadiq, Global Head of Enterprise Data Content at Bloomberg, said:
“Once categorized as an alternative data source, ESG data has quickly become integral to the value financial firms deliver to their clients. Executives are making significant strategic investments in ESG data acquisition and management to differentiate themselves and meet client and regulatory demand.”
By category, top priority areas for ESG data spending identified by the survey respondents included ESG benchmarks and indices at 24%, followed by company-reported factors at 19%, and ESG scores at 17%. Data quality was cited as the top ranked criteria for selecting an ESG data provider, followed by breadth of coverage, cost, and ease of integration.
Less than a third (29%) of respondents reported that their organizations utilized a firmwide approach for evaluating and implementing their ESG data needs, while more than half said that they follow a decentralized framework managed by individual business lines, and 18% reported using an ad hoc approach to acquiring and managing ESG data, with no formal process in place.
The survey also examined the challenges the executives faced in managing ESG data, with constantly evolving and new ESG data content cited as the most challenging aspect of their firms’ ESG data management, followed by the management of multiple ESG vendor feeds, and linking ESG content to existing entity or instrument data.
Don Huff, Global Head of Client Services and Operations at Bloomberg Data Management Services, said:
“As this research confirms, our customers are grappling with the challenge of integrating large volumes of ESG data from multiple sources and the lack of consistency between vendors can lead to data quality issues and operational disruptions.”
Gert Raeves, Research Director and Founder of Adox Research, added:
“While firms are planning for ESG data to become a part of mainstream data and research workflows, they realize that the age of ESG data behaving the same as other financial data sets has not yet arrived. In the meantime, they are prioritizing technical scalability and data transparency to make sure analysts, investors, and regulators have the right tools to select, curate, and enrich existing datasets with key ESG attributes.”

"September 4, 2023",Hong Kong Central Bank Directs Banks to Integrate Net Zero Transition Planning,"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Hong Kong’s central banking institution released a series of principles for banks on planning for the transition to a net zero economy, including ensuring that setting objectives aligned with a net zero transition, and embedding transition considerations into internal processes.
One of the HKMA’s key functions is to promote the stability and integrity of the financial system, including the banking system. According to a letter sent to the Chief Executives of all authorized institutions by HKMA’s Executive Director of Banking Policy Daryl Ho, the new high-level principles were designed “with a view to assisting banks in maintaining safety and soundness in the transition.”
Ho said:
“The HKMA recognises that international practices and discussions on transition planning and transition plans are still evolving. Nevertheless, given the increasing focus on the subject and in the light of the HKMA’s two-year plan, we consider it useful to set out some high-level principles to assist authorized institutions (AIs) in planning for a net-zero transition.”
The principles set out by the HKMA include setting clear targets and objectives – whether the primary purpose of a bank’s transition planning is the implementation of a transition strategy or the  development of a risk management process – with objectives guided to be aligned with a net zero transition, and targets aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, which include limiting the increase in global temperatures to well below 2°C, and preferably to 1.5°C.
The HKMA principles also guide banks to integrate transition considerations into internal processes, including governance, accountability and risk management frameworks, as well as into business strategies and models, products and services as necessary, and also to engage with clients on their own transition pathways, including collecting relevant information from clients and understanding the risks and opportunities that their sectors face in the transition to a net zero economy.
Additional principles set out by the HKMA for banks include enhancing the transparency of their transition planning processes and plans, and reviewing and updating transition planning as climate scenarios and sectoral pathways evolve over time.

"September 1, 2023",Biden Launches $12 Billion Finance Package for Automakers to Convert Factories to Produce EVs,"The Biden administration on Thursday announced a financing package of more than $15 billion aimed at supporting the transition to electric vehicles, including $10 billion in loans and $2 billion in grants to help automotive manufacturers convert factories to produce EVs.
Key criteria for applicants to the new program include the retention of jobs, wages and benefits at the manufacturing facilities, and projects supporting the administration’s initiatives to direct investments to disadvantaged communities.
In a White House statement announcing the new funding programs, Biden said:
“As I’ve said before, under Bidenomics building a clean energy economy can and should provide a win‑win opportunity for auto companies and unionized workers who have anchored the American economy for decades. This funding from my Investing in America agenda will further that goal by creating auto manufacturing jobs here at home and helping companies avoid painful plant closings — and to retool, reboot, and rehire in the same factories and communities with high wages.”
The new financing programs, launched by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), mark the latest in a series of initiatives by the administration aimed at accelerating the shift to clean mobility. President Biden signed an executive order signed in 2021 mandating that zero emissions vehicles make up half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. by 2030, and the administration’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) allocates billions in investments, grants and tax credits supporting EV and battery manufacturing and the buildout of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
The new DOE loan program will provide up to $10 billion for automotive manufacturing conversion projects that retain high-quality jobs in communities that currently host manufacturing facilities, under the DOE’s Loan Programs Office’s (LPO) Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program. In addition to ATVM criteria, considerations for projects funded will include the retention of existing workers, providing high wages and benefits, workplace rights, and commitments to keep facilities open until new facilities are complete. For projects that convert an existing factory, evaluation factors will include contribution to the local economy, employment history, anticipated employment, and facility duration. Applicants that currently pay top quartile wages in their industry and non-wage compensation benefits will be prioritized.
The $2 billion grant program, funded by the BIL, will support the expansion of light-, medium-, and heavy-duty electrified vehicles and components manufacturing, through cost-shared grants for domestic production of efficient hybrid, plug-in electric hybrid, plug-in electric drive, and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles. The program will give preference to projects committed to high wages for production workers and maintaining collective bargaining agreements, with selected projects also contributing to the administration’s Justice40 initiative, which targets directing 40% of clean energy investment benefits to disadvantaged communities, and those experiencing the worst impacts of climate change.
In addition to the loan and grant programs, the administration also announced that it intends to invest $3.5 billion to increase production of advanced batteries and battery materials for electric vehicles and grid storage.
U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm said:
“Today’s announcements show that President Biden understands that building the cars of the future also necessitates helping the communities challenged by the transition away from the internal combustion engine.”  ",ENERGY TRANSITION/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY
"August 31, 2023",AI-Based Metals Recycling Startup Sortera Raises $30 Million,"Material sorting startup Sortera Technologies announced that it has raised $30.5 million in a Series C funding round, with proceeds aimed at supporting the company’s growth and fully commercializing its first full-scale upcycling facility.

"August 31, 2023",Investors Urge ISSB to Develop Reporting Standard for Human Rights and Human Capital,"A group of investors representing over $1 trillion in assets under management has published a letter to the IFRS Foundation’s International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), urging it to prioritize the development of global reporting standards for companies to disclose on human capital and human rights.
The ISSB was launched in November 2021 at the COP26 climate conference, with the goal to develop IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, driven by demand from investors, companies, governments and regulators to provide a global baseline of disclosure requirements enabling a consistent understanding of the effect of sustainability risks and opportunities on companies’ prospects.
The ISSB published its first set of climate and sustainability reporting standards in June 2023, and recently launched a Request for Information (RFI) asking for feedback on priorities for its next two-year work plan, outlining four potential projects including biodiversity, ecosystems and ecosystem services; human capital; human rights, and; a research project on integration of sustainability information in financial reporting.
The letter, signed by 24 asset manager and asset owners across several countries, and coordinated by responsible investment NGO ShareAction, was sent in response to the ISSB’s RFI, and urges the board “to prioritise researching human capital and human rights disclosure standards,” noting that investor demand for workforce data and related issues has reached “an all-time high,” particularly as companies are being impacted by “growing resignation numbers, layoffs, and stalling labour market recoveries following the COVID-19 pandemic.”
The letter stated:
“It is imperative the ISSB prioritises human capital and human rights in its upcoming workplan. The financial materiality of human capital and human rights-related topics – and the critical role of human rights due diligence in identifying business risks – has never been clearer.”
The letter also called on the ISSB to integrate its projects on human capital and human rights, which were presented as separate topics in the RFI, arguing that companies and investors treat the topics as related areas in practice, with human rights due diligence used as key tools for identifying labor issues, and several areas of crossover existing, such as unionization and diversity and inclusion.
“To effectively meet this demand,” the letter stated, “this group calls on the ISSB to embark upon a joint research project which will serve to provide market clarity on how to consider and disclose human capital and human rights information as a whole.”
James Coldwell, Head of the Workforce Disclosure Initiative (WDI) at ShareAction said:
“We know that workers around the world face exploitation by unscrupulous companies, harming the workers themselves and creating risks for investors. Tackling these issues can only be achieved when there is transparency around corporate practices – something the ISSB is perfectly positioned to deliver. This is why we’re calling on them to prioritise research into human capital and human rights, to develop a globally accepted reporting framework.”

"August 31, 2023",Google Signs 189 MW Renewable Energy Purchase Agreement in North Carolina,"Apex Clean Energy announced that it has signed a 189 MW power purchase agreement (PPA) with Google for renewable energy generated from the upcoming North Carolina-based Timbermill Wind project. The deal, the first PPA between the companies, represents the full capacity of the new project, expected to begin full commercial operation in 2024-2025.
According to the companies, the new agreement will contribute to Google’s commitment to power all its operations on 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) by 2030. Google parent Alphabet announced a 24/7 CFE ambition in 2020, aiming to run its entire business on carbon-free energy by 2030. Operating on 24/7 CFE means matching electricity demand with CFE supply every hour of every day, in every region where the company operates.
The agreement marks the latest in a series of renewable energy announcements by Google, including a 15-year 150 MW PPA in April with energy provider Ørsted and a collaboration launched in March with renewable transaction infrastructure provider LevelTen Energy to provide a faster and easier RFP process for PPAs, speeding up the time to negotiate and execute deals by around 80%.
Donna Calderon, energy senior lead at Google, said:
“Within the decade we have an ambitious goal for every Google data center to operate on clean electricity, every hour of every day. We’re excited to work with Apex for the first time to not only add wind power to one of the most difficult grids to decarbonize, but also bring additional clean energy jobs to North Carolina.”
Construction of the 189 MW Timbermill wind farm began in May 2023. The facility will consist of up to 45 turbines spread across timber and agricultural lands, providing enough energy to power an estimated 47,000 homes annually. According to Apex, the project will contribute $190,000 to local conservation efforts, generate around $33 million in tax revenue, and provide and a new source of income for local landowners and farmers.
Ken Young, CEO of Apex, said:
“Timbermill Wind demonstrates the Apex team’s unmatched ability to execute on our expansive portfolio, even in a region notoriously difficult to advance wind power. Alongside Google, with shared values and an ambitious perspective of its role in the energy transition, we’re pleased to deliver this best-in-class project—one only achievable through this strong collaboration.”",COMPANIES/ ENERGY TRANSITION,ESGTODAY
"August 31, 2023",CIM Group Raises Over $400 Million to Grow Biogas Platform Terreva,"Real estate and infrastructure-focused owner and developer CIM Group announced that it has raised $417 million to support the growth of its renewable natural gas (RNG) portfolio company, Terreva Renewables.
RNG, or biomethane, is expected to play a critical role in the transition to cleaner energy sources, particularly for sectors in which energy solutions such as wind or solar are less practical. RNG is typically produced from organic waste, such as agricultural, industrial, and household wastes, and is chemically identical to fossil-based natural gas, enabling it to support the decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors such as road transport and heavy industry, without needing to replace existing transmission and distribution infrastructure.
CIM Group formed Terreva last year following its acquisition of MAS CanAm’s RNG development platform. Over the past year, Terreva has built several RNG facilities, including the completion of its first facility in Appleton, Wisconsin, and the commencement of operations of facilities in Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Virginia. The facilities convert landfill methane into RNG for large natural gas vehicle fleets, and, according to the company, have a projected carbon reduction equal to removing 21,600 cars from the road yearly or displacing 11.2 million gallons of gasoline.
According to a statement by CIM Group announcing the financing, the company is “tapping into the ever-increasing demand for RNG as a vital contributor to decarbonization efforts across transportation, utility and industrial applications.”
The company added that it is seeing strong regulatory support for RNG in transportation at federal and state levels, as well as and growing voluntary and regulatory demand from thermal users aiming to reduce their carbon footprints.
Avi Shemesh, Co-Founder and Principal, CIM Group, said:
“Terreva is delivering on our expectations for the platform and, alongside our co-investors, we are expanding Terreva to meet the increasing interest from communities across the country seeking its expertise to develop and operate RNG facilities.”",ENERGY TRANSITION/ PRIVATE EQUITY,ESGTODAY
"August 31, 2023",£1.5 Trillion Investor Group Warns that Uncertainty on Climate Policy Threatens Investment in UK Net Zero Transition,"Investors’ willingness to deploy capital to fund the UK’s net zero transition is at risk, as recent policy signals have reduced confidence in the government’s commitments to its climate policies, according to a new letter sent to Prime Minister Sunak by a group of financial institutions managing £1.5 trillion in assets under management.
The letter, signed by 36 members of the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association (UKSIF), comes as competition heats up globally among major economies to capitalize on the opportunities to participate in the global transition to cleaner energy systems and industries, with massive energy transition investment plans recently unveiled by the U.S., the EU and Canada and each region looking to attract massive private sector investments as well. According to the UKSIF, however, uncertainty emanating from the government threatens the UK’s position in the clean transition race.
UKSIF Chief Executive James Alexander said:
“The global competition to capture billions of pounds of private investment in the clean industries of the future is intense. Ministers’ recent remarks are undermining investor confidence and putting the UK’s net zero head start at risk.”
The UK government legislated a target to reach net zero emissions by 2050 in 2019, and in the following years announced a series of policies and investment pledges aimed at reaching its goal, including plans to accelerate the shift to low carbon transportation, build out clean energy capacity, and help decarbonize industry.
The government also launched its Green Finance Strategy in 2019, updated earlier this year, aimed at establishing the UK as a center for international green finance, and aligning the financial sector and capital flows with the delivery of global and domestic climate and environmental objectives.
Recent policy statements by the Sunak government, however, including the approval of new North Sea oil and gas drilling licenses in July, and reports of pushback within the government on policies such as the announced ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030, “risk undermining the UK’s leadership in the clarity, certainty, and confidence of policymaking toward meeting the UK’s commitment to net zero,” according to the investor letter.
The letter adds that the government’s recent policy signals and public statements “blurs regulatory visibility for investors and risks the ability of the finance sector to make the large-scale, transformative investments required to accelerate net-zero delivery and unlock growth in the UK.”
In order to facilitate the estimated £50-60 billion of investment needed to achieve the UK’s net zero goals, the investor group called on the government to “provide long-term policy certainty,” ensuring that the policies driving the investments, such as carbon pricing mechanisms, the shift to zero emissions vehicles and energy efficiency standards for housing “will not be changed abruptly.”
The investors added:
“Building on the UK’s position as the world’s largest net exporter of financial services, sustainable finance is a major growth industry in the UK. Purposeful and predictable policy at home can position the UK financial services sector as a global leader in green investment, driving further prosperity and growth, including in emerging financial services centres outside London.”

"August 18, 2023",Sustainable Mining Solutions Company Ceibo Raises $30 Million,"Sustainable mining technology company Ceibo announced that it has raised more than $30 million at the close of its Series B financing round, with proceeds aimed at accelerating its leaching process to extract copper more economically and sustainably.
Copper is one of the key materials needed to support the transition to a low-carbon economy, with demand expected to rise over the next several years as energy, transportation and industrial systems shift heavily towards electrification, increasing the need for sustainable and economical extraction methods.
Santiao, Chile-based Ceibo provides a leaching process that can increase the production of copper, while reducing water use and environmental impact of extraction. Leaching is one of the most sustainable copper recovery technologies, but historically was inefficient for copper found deeper in the earth, where most reserves are located, and which typically use water and energy intensive concentration and smelting processes. Ceibo’s process enables leaching to be used for reserves where the process could not normally be applied. The process was designed for easy integration into operations, and uses existing infrastructure at mines.
The financing was led by energy transition-focused venture capital investor Energy Impact Partners, and included participation from a mining-focused investors including CoTec Holding, Audley Capital, Orion Industrial Ventures, Unearth Capital and Opalton, as well as existing investors Khosla Ventures and Aurus Ventures.

"August 17, 2023",EU Adopts Rules Requiring Product Emissions Reporting for New Import Carbon Tax,"The European Commission announced today the adoption of reporting rules for importers of products under the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), the EU’s new carbon tax on imported goods, aimed at equalizing the carbon price paid by European producers with those outside the EU.
The new rules will require companies to begin collecting data on the embedded emissions of imported products in October of this year, with reporting beginning by the end of January 2024, and will apply through the transitional phase of CBAM, which runs until the end of 2025.
The main purpose of CBAM, adopted by the EU earlier this year, is to avoid “carbon leakage,” a situation in which companies move production of emissions intensive goods to countries with less stringent environmental and climate policies.
CBAM will equalize the price of carbon paid for EU products operating under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) – the EU’s internal cap and trade carbon pricing mechanism – with that paid for products produced in other countries, with companies that import into the EU required to purchase CBAM certificates in order to make up the difference.
Under the newly adopted rules, importers will be required to report on the embedded emissions of goods imported into the EU, with information including the country of origin of the goods, the installation where the goods were produced and the geographical coordinates of the main emissions source of the facility. Importers will be required to report on products’ direct emissions, including through the production process of the goods expressed as CO2e per tonne, and on indirect emissions, with information including the electricity consumption of the production process.
CBAM will initially apply to specific products from carbon intensive sectors, including iron and steel, cement, fertilizers, aluminum, electricity, hydrogen, and some downstream products such as screws and bolts, as well as to some indirect emissions under certain conditions. In the transition phase, which runs until 2026 importer obligations are limited only to reporting of product emissions.
The EU Commission added that it has also published guidance today to help importers and third country producers to implement the new rules, and noted that dedicated IT tools to help importers perform and report the required calculations are currently being developed, along with training materials, webinars and tutorials.",ESG REPORTING/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY

"August 16, 2023",Guest Post: SEC’s Proposed Regulations Will Help Investors Understand Their Climate Risks,"By: Jake Kuyer, Associate Director, and Sarah Nelson, Senior Economist at Oxford Economics
Imagine buying a second-hand car. What information would you like to know? Perhaps its model year, odometer mileage, and fuel efficiency would help you assess how much it will cost to run and how polluting it might be. Maybe you’d like to have a mechanic check under the hood, to assess the risk that your new purchase will sputter out as you drive it off the lot.
Now imagine that the car dealer refused to tell you the mileage and won’t let a mechanic take a look at the car. Would you buy it? Probably not. This example, based on George Akerlof’s classic “market for lemons” theory, shows how market failures arise from a mismatch between what the seller knows and what the buyer knows or — as economists would put it — from an information asymmetry.
Information asymmetries abound in financial markets. Investors can’t know all the ins-and-outs of a company, but they must make their investment decisions anyway. Financial regulators like the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) can help, by requiring companies to disclose any risks and dependencies that are financially material.
If the SEC could assist in our ill-fated car sale, it would require the dealer to hand over the relevant information. It would also set out how that information should be presented, so that you can easily compare it to information provided by other dealers. They would help you make the best decision on your car purchase and help the market run efficiently.  
Compulsory impact disclosure
The SEC has recently announced two major proposals to help investors understand their impacts and risks. Most of the time, the SEC’s announcements are met with a collective yawn by the public and politicians alike. Its latest proposals, however, have been making waves.
In March last year, the Commission published a proposal that would require listed companies to disclose climate-related impacts and risks to their business. The rules follow the recommendations of the Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), recently brought under the umbrella of the International Sustainability Standards Board, itself aligned with the International Financial Reporting Standards to which most companies in the world align their financial reporting. The TCFD recommendations have already been adopted in some form by the European Union, the UK, Canada, and other major US trading partners.
The SEC followed this announcement in May 2022 with proposed amendments to how funds and advisors incorporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in their investments. Funds would have to provide more information for ESG-labelled assets, including disclosing the impacts of any assets with specific goals and reporting progress with reliable metrics.
While investors have been mostly supportive of the proposals, the reception from some politicians has been frosty, to say the least. Opponents have claimed everything from agency overreach to violations of free speech and partisan activism. To the contrary, the proposed regulations do not interfere with capital market valuation. The SEC is not in the business of directing investment or making value judgements — that’s for investors to do.
Arguably, that is literally investors’ jobs: to put a price on a company by buying or selling stocks.  The SEC’s proposals are about ensuring relevant information is available, not what is done with it. If an investor decides they aren’t concerned about climate-related risks and other factors, then they don’t have to act on them.  
Trust in the claims
Climate change is only one factor that could materially affect investments’ value and returns. Regulation in Europe has taken a broad approach to risk disclosures that highlights other considerations. Nature-related dependencies include the threat that biodiversity loss will cause disruptions to its upstream supply chain, often in countries far beyond the company’s direct sphere of influence. Social and geopolitical factors come into play as well.
The SEC’s proposed disclosures take a relatively limited stance to risk disclosures by focusing only on climate risks, but it is a key first step in providing investors with material information to support their decision-making process. Meanwhile the proposed amendments to ESG claims will help avoid mislabelling and thereby mis-selling financial products. It makes sense that consumers of financial products should be able to trust the claims being made about what they are considering investing in.
Deciding the value of a company in the face of a changing climate and economy is significantly more complex than purchasing a used car. But the same principles apply. Being able to compare products and understand the risks is essential to your willingness to complete a trade. Climate disclosures and ESG claims do not tell you whether you should buy a share or not — just as a car mechanic doesn’t make the final decision on your purchase. But the information they both provide will give you an indication of the risks and rewards involved, allowing you to make a more informed decision.
What car buyer wouldn’t want to make their purchase based on the best information available? American investors, operating in one of the most mature, innovative, and successful capital markets in the world, deserve the same benefit.",ESG REPORTING/ GUEST POSTS,ESGTODAY
"August 16, 2023",Google to Address Business Travel Emissions with Sustainable Aviation Fuel Purchases,"American Express Global Business Travel (Amex GBT) and Shell Aviation announced today that Google has joined the companies’ sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) program, enabling companies to offset business travel emissions through SAF purchases, and supporting the scale-up of SAF production.
Launched last year with 1 million gallons of SAF on the blockchain-powered Avelia platform, the program utilizes a book-and-claim model, enabling business travelers to pay for SAF and claim the environmental benefits, even if the SAF is not available at their departure airport. The solution was developed by Shell and Accenture, with the support of the Energy Web Foundation (EWF), and includes Amex GBT’s travel management services to aggregate global demand for SAF from its 19,000 global customers.
Michael Terrell, Sr. Director of Climate and Energy at Google, said:
“The use of SAF will play a critical role in helping the aviation sector on its path to decarbonize. Joining Amex GBT’s sustainable aviation fuel program further represents Google’s continued efforts to accelerate the global transition to a carbon-free future.”
Sustainable aviation fuel is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry, which currently accounts for 2-3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Demand for SAF is likely to rise dramatically over the next few years, as airlines turn to the technology as one of the key solutions to hit their climate goals, and as governments begin to mandate increased SAF use to achieve their own decarbonization ambitions.
Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF face significant challenges, however, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels.
Google, Amex GBT and Shell are each members of the World Economic Forum’s First Movers Coalition, which encourages companies in sectors where decarbonization is a challenge, including aviation, to increase low-carbon purchases to help scale decarbonization solutions and technologies.
Andrew Crawley, President, American Express Global Business Travel, said:
“Business travel is a crucial passenger segment for aviation, accounting for around 15% of air travel globally and generating around 40% of revenues. To have Google join our growing SAF program demonstrates how corporate collaboration can accelerate aviation’s transition to net zero and enable more sustainable travel.”
Jan Toschka, President of Shell Aviation, added:
“Considering Google’s stature and prominence this announcement represents an important milestone for decarbonising aviation. As scaling the uptake of SAF will only be possible if all parts of the aviation value chain work together, we’re thrilled to work with such an influential and forward-thinking company.”",COMPANIES/ ENERGY TRANSITION,ESGTODAY
"August 16, 2023",Oxy Acquires DAC Carbon Removal Provider Carbon Engineering for $1.1 Billion,"Energy giant Occidental (Oxy) announced today the acquisition of Carbon Engineering, a Canadian-based provider of Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology that removes CO2 from the atmosphere and utilizes it to create clean fuels, in a deal valued at $1.1 billion.
The acquisition agreement follows the announcement last week that a large scale DAC project by Oxy’s carbon capture platform 1PointFive, being developed in partnership with Carbon Engineering has been selected as one of two projects to receive up to $1.2 billion in grants by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).
DAC technology, listed by the IEA as a key carbon removal option in the transition to a net-zero energy system, extracts CO2 directly from the atmosphere for use as a raw material or permanently removed when combined with storage. According to the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change mitigation study released last year, scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C include carbon dioxide removal methods scaling to billions of tons of removal annually over the coming decades, with DAC positioned to potentially account for a significant portion of the total.
Founded in 2009, British Columbia-based Carbon Engineering is a provider of DAC technology that pulls in atmospheric air and extracts the carbon dioxide through a series of chemical reactions, which is then concentrated, purified and compressed for permanent storage or utilization. The company also provides “AIR TO FUELS” technology, which combines its DAC solution with hydrogen generation and fuel sythensis to produce ultra-low carbon transportation fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).
The company has partnered with Oxy’s 1PointFive for widespread, large-scale DAC deployment. 1PointFive, in partnership with Carbon Engineering, is currently building Stratos, capable of removing more than 250 times more carbon dioxide than the world’s largest DAC facility currently operating.
Carbon Engineering CEO Daniel Friedmann, said:
“We have always believed that global partnerships and cross-industry collaboration would be required to deploy DAC infrastructure at the scale required to make a climate-relevant impact. Carbon Engineering and Occidental have been working increasingly close together for the past five years to address the CO2 problem, making Occidental a trusted and committed partner for this next chapter in Carbon Engineering’s journey.”
According to Oxy, the integration of Carbon Engineering will help improve cost and capital efficiencies, add new revenue streams including technology licensing and royalties, provide the opportunity to advance DAC technology, and accelerate the deployment of Direct Air Capture “as a large-scale, cost effective, global carbon removal solution.”
Occidental President and CEO Vicki Hollub said:
“Together, Occidental and Carbon Engineering can accelerate plans to globally deploy DAC technology at a climate-relevant scale and make DAC the preferred solution for businesses seeking to remove their hard-to-abate emissions.”

"August 15, 2023",S&P Launches Service Enabling Investors to Assess Portfolio Nature & Biodiversity Risk,"S&P Global’s ESG and sustainability-focused business Sustainable1 announced today the launch of its new Nature & Biodiversity Risk portfolio assessment services, aimed at enabling financial institutions to understand and assess portfolio nature-related risks.
The new service comes as businesses and financial institutions increasingly focus on nature and biodiversity risk, and as global efforts to address nature-related issues begin to pick up pace. In December 2022, for example, global governments adopted the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework at the COP15 UN Biodiversity Conference, agreeing to a set of goals aimed at ending biodiversity loss, protecting natural ecosystems and ramping biodiversity-related financing.
S&P’s new service will leverage its recently launched Nature & Biodiversity Risk dataset, which lets companies and investors to assess, manage and address nature-related risks and impacts, covering over 17,000 companies and more than 1.6 million assets, using nature-related risk metrics such as The Ecosystem Footprint (measuring the land area, ecosystem degradation, and ecosystem significance) to deliver a deeper understanding of a company’s impact and dependency on nature.
According to the company, the new service will allow financial institutions to understand and explore nature-related impacts and dependencies in their portfolios, as recommended by the Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) and in line with the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) approach.","ENVIRONMENT/ ESG REPORTING/ ESG TOOLS, SERVICES",ESGTODAY
"August 15, 2023",HSBC’s New Energy Transition Platform Makes First Investment in Solar Developer Tekoma Energy,"HSBC Asset Management announced an investment by its Energy Transition Infrastructure (ETI) team Tokyo-based solar platform Tekoma Energy.
The investment marks the first for HSBC’s ETI platform, formed following the asset manager’s addition of an energy transition infrastructure-focused investment team to its alternatives unit in Asia, in a business transfer agreement with Hong Kong-based asset manager Green Transition Partners earlier this year.

"August 15, 2023",Green Hydrogen Startup Advanced Ionics Raises $12.5 Million in bp-led Funding Round,"Cleantech startup Advanced Ionics announced today that it has raised $12.5 million, with proceeds from the funding round supporting the deployment of its green hydrogen production technology aimed at helping to decarbonize heavy industry.
The financing was led by energy giant bp’s venture arm bp Ventures, and included participation from investors including Clean Energy Ventures, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and GVP Climate.
Hydrogen is viewed as one of the key building blocks of the transition to a cleaner energy future, particularly for sectors with difficult to abate emissions, in which renewable energy solutions such as wind or solar are less practical. The development of clean hydrogen capacity, such as green hydrogen, which uses renewable energy to power the process to extract hydrogen from other materials, will require massive investments in areas including infrastructure, electrolysis, transport and storage.
Founded in 2017, Milwaukee-based Advanced Ionics provides solutions aimed at enabling the large-scale production of green hydrogen, and addressing the key obstacles to the acceleration of green hydrogen, including high costs and electricity requirements, with electricity accounting for more than 70% of green hydrogen production costs. The company’s water vapor electrolyzer technology, Symbion, reduces cost and electricity requirements for green hydrogen production, combining onsite process and waste heat from industrial sites, and the system is made of widely available steels and other simple materials, in the place of more expensive materials common in other electrolyzers.
According to the company, the lower electricity requirements enabled by its solution could reduce the cost of green hydrogen production to under $1 per kilogram.
Chad Mason, CEO of Advanced Ionics said:
“bp ventures’ investment in Advanced Ionics is a powerful backing of our technology’s potential to help accelerate green hydrogen’s future and heavy industry’s shift towards decarbonization. The results we’ve achieved in our testing along with early customer interest have indicated that we are an ideal technology provider for industrial customers looking to augment, expand or replace their existing hydrogen production facilities with green hydrogen.”
According to Advanced Ionics, funds from the Series A financing will be used to expand its team, and deliver its electrolyzer systems to early customers.
In addition to its investment, bp said that it will explore pilot opportunities with Advanced Ionics. Hydrogen is one of the bp’s five transition growth engines, alongside bioenergy, convenience, electric vehicle charging, and renewables & power. Last year, bp announced that it plans to increase the proportion of its total capex in these transition growth businesses to more than 40% by 2025 and around 50% by 2030.
Gareth Burns, Vice President of bp ventures, said:
“Advanced Ionics’ technology has the potential to drive down cost and disrupt the hydrogen market. bp has a global portfolio of hydrogen projects, and as the world transitions to a net zero future, it’s important to us to be investing in these technologies and advance the track to deploying green hydrogen. We look forward to working with Advanced Ionics on the next stage of its growth.”",COMPANIES/ ENERGY TRANSITION/ PRIVATE EQUITY,ESGTODAY
"August 15, 2023",Australia Regulator Launches Greenwashing Suit Against Active Super over ESG Investing Claims,"The Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC), Australia’s corporate, markets, and financial services regulator, announced that it has launched a court action against superannuation fund Active Super, alleging that the fund made misleading ESG-related claims to members, by investing in companies in sectors that it had claimed to eliminate from its holdings.
In a statement released by ASIC announcing the commencement of the civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court, the regulator outlined statements made by Active Super on its website and in social media postings claiming that the fund “eliminate(s) investments that pose too great a risk to the environment and community,” and providing tobacco, nuclear weapons, oil tar sands and gambling as examples. Active Super also said that it had added Russia to its list of excluded countries following the invasion of Ukraine.
Source: ASIC
According to the ASIC allegations, however, the fund held 28 holdings which exposed members to these areas between February 2021 and June 2023, including holdings in casino operator Skycity Entertainment Group, tobacco company Amcor, and Russian oil and gas companies Gazprom and Rosneft.
The regulator added that Active Super continued to have holdings in Russian securities as of June 30, 2023, despite making representations in May 2022 that it would stop investments in Russian companies.
ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said:
“There is much competition among super funds for new members, and we know that funds seek to attract members with promises their investments will not be exposed to certain industries. When making these claims super funds must have evidence to back their claims and ensure they are not promising exclusions that they cannot guarantee.”
The announcement marks ASIC’s third greenwashing penalty proceedings launch so far this year, following the commencement of cases against Marsh McLennan company Mercer Superannuation and Vanguard Investments Australia.  The cases follow a statement last year by ASIC Chair Joseph Longo, warning providers of investment funds and financial products that the regulator was watching out for misleading sustainability claims, and that it was providing guidance for fund managers and issuers to keep clear of greenwashing. 
In a statement following the ASIC announcement, Active Super said:
“Active Super has co-operated with ASIC’s investigation and welcomes increased scrutiny on ESG disclosure standards as being good for members, the super industry and the community. As the matter is before the courts we are unable to comment further.”
ASIC said that it is seeking declarations, pecuniary penalties, adverse publicity orders and an injunction against Active Super from the Court. ",INVESTORS/ REGULATORS,ESGTODAY

"August 14, 2023",Tesco to Reduce Emissions in Forest and Farm Supply Chains,"UK-based multinational grocery retailer Tesco announced a series of new climate-focused commitments, including interim goals to reduce Scope 3 emissions originating in its supply chain at the forest and agricultural level, and a target to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions from its own operations by 85% by 2030.
The new targets form part of the company’s goals, set in 2021, to reach net zero in its operations by 2035, and across its value chain by 2050.
Tesco’s new value chain goals include targets to reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions from energy and industrial sources by 55% and forests, land and agriculture (FLAG) emissions by 39%  by 2032, from a 2019 baseline.
Food and beverage sector emissions account for about a third of global GHG emissions and are among the most difficult to address, with the vast majority coming from the supply chains of food and beverage companies, rather than from “direct” emissions from the companies’ operations.
According to Tesco’s most recent sustainability report, more than 90% of the company’s emissions footprint originates in its value chain, including more than half of emissions generated from the production of the products it sells.
The company outlined some of the initiatives it will pursue under the “improve our products” category of its ‘Planet’ sustainability agenda to help address its supply chain emissions, including achieving 100% deforestation free across all primary risk commodities by 2025, rolling out sustainable agriculture innovations such as low carbon fertilizers among key vegetable suppliers, and having suppliers commit to a net zero ambition by the end of 2023.
Additional categories under Tesco’s Planet agenda include decarbonizing transport, reducing store emissions, supporting sustainable consumption, eliminating waste, and protecting nature.
The company also announced that its new goals have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), making Tesco one of the first retailers globally to have SBTi approved targets, and one of the first companies globally to have specific FLAG targets validated by the SBTi.

“We’ve led the way on action on climate change, from adopting 100% renewable electricity across the Group, to scaling innovations in our supply chains. We now must work even harder, in collaboration with our suppliers and partners, to achieve our goals. These ambitious targets, validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative, now provide us with a clear roadmap of action over the next ten years and beyond.” ",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT,ESGTODAY
"August 11, 2023","U.S. Grants $1.2 Billion to Develop Oxy, Climeworks Carbon Removal Projects","The U.S. Department of Energy announced today the selection of two projects by energy giant Occidental’s (Oxy) carbon capture platform 1PointFive, and carbon removal cleantech Climeworks to receive grants of up to $1.2 billion to develop direct air capture (DAC) facilities capable of capturing and storing millions of tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere.
The awards mark the largest-ever investment in engineered carbon removal.
DAC technology, listed by the IEA as a key carbon removal option in the transition to a net-zero energy system, extracts CO2 directly from the atmosphere for use as a raw material or permanently removed when combined with storage. According to the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change mitigation study released last year, scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C include carbon dioxide removal methods scaling to billions of tons of removal annually over the coming decades, with DAC positioned to potentially account for a significant portion of the total.
Most solutions that capture and store CO2 are early stage and currently limited in scale, including DAC. The selected projects would dramatically increase global DAC capacity, with a combined ability to remove more than 2 million metric tons of CO2 emissions annually, and each capable of removing more than 250 times more carbon dioxide than the largest DAC facility currently operating, according to the DOE.
The DOE added that supporting the development of the projects “will help inform future public and private sector investments and jumpstart a new industry critical to addressing the climate crisis on a global scale.”
U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm, said:
“With this once-in-a-generation investment made possible by President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, DOE is laying the foundation for a direct air capture industry crucial to tackling climate change—transforming local economies and delivering healthier communities along the way.”
The projects selected include the Louisiana- based Project Cypress DAC Hub by Climeworks, applied science nonprofit organization Battelle and DAC technology company Heirloom, and 1PointFive’s South Texas DAC Hub, currently in front-end design and engineering with partners Carbon Engineering and Worley.
The selection enables the projects to proceed with award negotiations with the DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), with the funding supporting the development of the DAC hubs, including the projects’ planning, design, environmental permitting and long-lead equipment procurement.
Oxy President and CEO Vicki Hollub said:
“We appreciate the U.S. Department of Energy’s leadership to advance Direct Air Capture and look forward to our partnership to deploy this vital carbon removal technology at climate-relevant scale and establish the United States and 1PointFive as global leaders in demonstrating the commercial viability of DAC. We believe this selection validates our readiness, technical maturity and the ability to use Oxy’s expertise in large projects and carbon management to move the technology forward so it can reach its full potential.”
Daniel Nathan, Chief Project Development Officer at Climeworks, said:
“The Notification of Selection is a recognition that Project Cypress has what it takes to contribute to the build-up of the American DAC ecosystem. It is a testament to Climeworks’ proven ability to deliver high-quality, high-integrity carbon removal via DAC+S and we are excited to work alongside all project partners to bring DAC technology to the Gulf Coast.”",ENVIRONMENT/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY
"August 11, 2023",Canada Releases Clean Electricity Regulations Targeting a Net Zero Grid by 2035,"The Government of Canada on Thursday released its proposed Clean Electricity Regulations, aimed at advancing the decarbonization of the country’s electricity grid, and supporting its net zero emission climate goals.
The release of the new regulations follows Canada’s commitment, made by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the COP26 climate conference in 2021, to achieve a net zero electricity grid by 2035. Canada also joined a G7 commitment in May 2022 to reach “predominantly decarbonized” electricity sectors by 2035.
Canada also joined a commitment last year with the U.S. to release clean energy regulations in 2023. Earlier this year, the Biden administration released a set of proposals aimed at reducing U.S. power sector emissions, including putting in place CO2 emissions controls at fossil fuel-fired power plants starting in 2030.
Calling the release of the draft regulation “a giant step forward in the fight against climate change,” Minister of Environment and Climate Change Steven Guilbeault added that the decarbonization of Canada’s power grid will also create opportunities from the growing demand for electricity from clean technologies, and ultimately lower energy costs and support the move away from volatile oil and gas prices.
According to government estimates, the regulations will result in emissions reductions from the electricity generation sector of over 340 million tonnes by 2050.
Guilbeault said:
“A net-zero grid will serve as the basis for climate actions across the economy, like helping Canadians switch to electric transportation and heating, or the development of new and cleaner industries. The benefits, in terms of good jobs and clean air in our communities, are enormous.”
The regulations set stringent pollution standards for power generation, but does not prescribe specific energy technologies to be used. In a statement announcing the draft regulations, the government said that the “technology-neutral approach enables provincial, territorial, and municipal decision-makers to determine the most suitable path for transitioning to a clean grid in their circumstances.”
The rules also permit fossil fuel-based power generation to remain in place for several years beyond the implementation of the regulations in 2035 in some circumstances, with requirements for emissions to remain under 30 tonnes of CO2 per GWh, mandating the use of carbon capture technology in most cases. The regulations also include exemptions for remote communities not connected to larger grids, with limited ability to replace fossil-based generation.
Environmental groups welcomed the new proposed regulations, but criticized the government’s move to continue to allow fossil fuel-based power generation.
Stephen Thomas, Clean Energy Manager, David Suzuki Foundation, said that the regulations will move Canada “one step closer to achieving 100 per cent zero-emissions electricity by 2035,” but that the fossil fuel allowance “will need much improvement before the regulations are finalized.”
Thomas added:
“This is yet another policy where we are seeing the fossil fuel industry’s efforts to dilute climate action. These regulations as written will allow more fossil fuels to be built and continue to supply electricity on the grid. Loopholes and exemptions cannot be made for fossils fuels if we hope to achieve the 2035 target.”",ENERGY TRANSITION/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY

"August 10, 2023",Guest Post: A New Seat for Tax at the Sustainability Table,"By: Brett Weaver, ESG Tax Leader, and Richard Marcos, Tax Credits Practice Leader, KPMG U.S.
There’s no question that sustainability is an increasingly important consideration for businesses around the world. But with new green initiatives that use the tax code to offer substantial credits, like the Inflation Reduction Act, tax departments are entering the conversation in a whole new way. As a result, tax professionals will have to take on an expanded role in both data management and early strategic planning.
Organizations today are making growing commitments to environmental, social, and governance responsibility, and governments around the world are offering an array of incentives that are dramatically different from those of the past, in both quantity and quality. In the United States and Europe especially, green initiatives have put a lot of money on the table while making incentives more accessible—though also more complex and data-intensive. And because these initiatives are managed through the tax code, they have given tax professionals a central role in what must be a coordinated and proactive decision-making process, as well as offering them a seat at the sustainability table.
The Inflation Reduction Act brings real value to sustainability
In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 directs nearly $400 billion in federal funding toward lowering the country’s carbon emissions by the end of the decade through clean energy, clean transportation, and other commitments to the renewables space. Its arrival on the scene has fundamentally shifted the landscape of tax incentives for sustainable practices.
Although the IRA focuses on clean energy, it also includes several social aspects of sustainability—things like bonus credits for paying a “prevailing wage,” or for including apprenticeships in work that’s being done, and even for locating projects in a brownfield, where there was a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant in the past (e.g., a coal mine). There are also similar bonuses for basing a facility within a low-income tract and using domestic materials such as U.S. steel and iron.
For companies, these credits, grants, and incentives—and their complex qualification requirements that require extensive evidentiary support—can quickly become a data-management story. But it’s a story worth telling well. Getting the details right, with proper documentation, can make a significant difference in the size of the benefit. Companies that navigate this landscape strategically can see benefits totaling 50% of the cost of building a facility. This, in turn, can translate into many millions of dollars in government funding.
Improved access
In addition to being more varied, credits are now also far more accessible. In the past, companies might generate credits but would often struggle to benefit from them, which often required jumping through complicated hoops. In short, credits today are easier to monetize. Years ago, a hospital that usually didn’t pay tax couldn’t benefit from the credit if it installed solar panels on its roof. Today, however, it can take the credit, monetize it immediately, and use the cash to hire more critical healthcare workers.
While organizations can continue to also access other tax credits, the advantage of the IRA is that it builds its new incentives directly into the tax code. That allows every taxpayer to apply for the same credits, making them more broadly accessible than previous discretionary funding programs.
A new role for tax
So, what does this all mean for corporate tax departments? Well, at the end of the day, it’s the tax professionals who have to get the numbers right, by asking (and answering) the right questions: Was the prevailing wage met? How many apprenticeships are required? What percentage of the iron was domestic? And it’s the tax department that must ensure the documentation and support is there to back up those claims. Data management, then, takes on a whole new importance for the tax professionals of today.
Early engagement is key to good data management. The questions that arise require close coordination across departments. But unlike in the past, when the tax people were often locked out of early project planning by confidentiality considerations, optimizing these new credits requires bringing tax into a company’s green initiatives from the earliest stages. Those early decisions—how you build a facility, add capabilities, or electrify your fleets—can add up to a significant percentage of your company’s transition to sustainability.
As governments increasingly use the tax code to create compelling but complex new incentives for sustainable practices, companies wanting to optimize their credits need to adjust their early decision-making and view the tax department as a vital partner in planning early on.",COMPANIES/ GUEST POSTS,ESGTODAY

"August 10, 2023",Sustainable Bond Proceeds Disproportionately Allocated to Climate Mitigation over Adaptation: Fitch,"Issuers of green and sustainability bonds are directing the proceeds from their issuances primarily on climate change-related projects, and disproportionately focusing on climate mitigation initiatives to reduce emissions over climate adaptation, despite a significant need for capital to address physical climate risks, according to a new report from Fitch Group’s sustainability-focused analytics business, Sustainable Fitch.
For the report, Sustainable Fitch examined the green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked labeled bonds rated by its ESG Ratings service, with a focus on the instruments’ Use of Proceeds’ contribution to green and social impact, and the level of transparency and ambition in project or target selection.
The study found that most issuers scored well for their bonds’ Use of Proceeds, with UoPs typically receiving scores of 1 or 2, or excellent or good, based on their contributions to the level of transparency and ambition in project or target selection. A skew towards capital intensive and climate mitigation-focused projects, however, suggested that some activities remain underfunded, such as pollution prevention, employment generation and climate adaptation.
Within green bonds, climate mitigation categories dominate the use of proceeds selections, with renewable energy as the most common UoP category, at 27% of all UoPs, followed by energy efficiency at 22%, and clean transport and green buildings at 16% each. By region, U.S. issuers have the largest number of renewable energy UoPs, despite lower regulatory pressure to decarbonize. The report also noted that while the vast majority of US-based issuers with renewable energy UoPs are regional power utilities, several EU countries have many banks with renewable energy UoPs, with proceeds supporting green loans provided to the energy sector.
Sustainability bonds, which can use proceeds for a mix of social and environmental activities, are dominated by green UoPs, which represent 63%, and with green buildings as the most common UoP, with social accounting for 37%, with socioeconomic empowerment activities, such as loans to underrepresented minority-owned SMEs, as the most common social category.
While climate change was found to be the predominant focus of most green, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds, the report indicated a heavy focus by issuers on climate mitigation activities such as renewable energy, green buildings, and clean transportation. The report noted that very few issuances had UoPs explicitly focused on climate adaptation, despite estimates from the UN Environmental Programme that the annual cost of climate adaptation will reach $160 billion – $340 billion by 2030.
The report added:
“We believe going beyond mitigation to focus on and finance climate adaptation is paramount, particularly for sectors such as real estate that remain most exposed to physical climate risks and are also the largest recipient of green and sustainable instrument-backed financing.”
The most common UoP categories selected for social bonds include affordable housing, at 30%, and socioeconomic advancement, also at 30%, followed by affordable basic infrastructure at 26%, while the least common was food security, at only 1%, with the report noting that agriculture and food production companies appear to be facing greater stakeholder pressure on environmental issues compared to social issues.
One of the key issues affecting the quality of sustainable bonds identified by the report was the lack of proceeds specified to be allocated specifically to new projects, which have the highest additionality on impact, versus existing projects. The report found that 90% of bonds allocated only between 1% to 24% of proceeds to new projects or did not disclose new vs existing information, while only 3% of rated entities specified that more than 75% of proceeds will be allocated to new projects.

"August 9, 2023",California Launches Strategy to Scale Up Clean Hydrogen Economy,"California Governor Gavin Newsom announced plans to develop a new Hydrogen Market Development Strategy, aimed at building the state’s clean hydrogen market, in order to establish California as a U.S. hydrogen hub, and to help achieve its decarbonization goals.
Hydrogen is viewed as one of the key building blocks of the transition to a cleaner energy future, particularly for sectors with difficult to abate emissions, in which renewable energy solutions such as wind or solar are less practical.
The development of clean hydrogen capacity, such as green hydrogen, which uses renewable energy to power the process to extract hydrogen from other materials, will require massive investments in areas including infrastructure, electrolysis, transport and storage.
Newsom’s announcement follows the Biden administration’s release in June of the U.S. National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap, aimed at significantly ramping the production, use and distribution of low carbon hydrogen for use in energy intensive industries and including a goal to scale U.S. clean hydrogen production and use to 10 million metric tonnes by 2030, and as much as 50 million tonnes by 2050.
The U.S.’ Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocates $8 billion for the development of clean hydrogen hubs to create networks of hydrogen producers, consumers, and local connective infrastructure, aimed at reducing emissions in the transport and industrial sectors. According to Newsom’s office’s statement, the state’s new strategy aims to support California’s efforts to compete to become one of the federally funded hydrogen hubs.
The statement added that the strategy also aims to expand the market for clean and renewable hydrogen, one of the keys to achieving California’s climate goals targeting a clean electricity grid, net zero carbon emissions, and a significant reduction in air pollution.
Newsom said:
“California is all in on clean, renewable hydrogen – an essential aspect of how we’ll power our future and cut pollution. This strategy will lay out the pathway for building a robust hydrogen market to help us fully embrace this source of clean energy.”
According to the Governor’s office, the new initiative will create a market development strategy focused on leveraging clean hydrogen to accelerate clean energy deployment and decarbonize California’s transportation and industrial sectors. Newsom has directed the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz) to develop the strategy, in consultation with state agencies including the California Air Resources Board, the California Energy Commission, and the California Public Utilities Commission, and to clearly define each agency’s roles and responsibilities, and to identify shared strategies, including financing models, permitting modifications and procurement initiatives, to deliver projects.
In a letter to GO-Biz Director Dee Dee Myers directing the strategy’s development, Newsom said:
“Scaling this in California isn’t just about addressing the climate crisis – it’s also about creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and cleaning the air in our communities. It’s about continuing to lead our country forward, building on our success in the zero-emission vehicle and clean electricity markets.”",ENERGY TRANSITION/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY
"August 9, 2023",Guest Post – ESRS: A New Chapter in Sustainability Reporting,"By: Reinhilde Weidacher, Managing Director, Head of EMEA Solutions, ISS Corporate Solutions
The European Commission today (July 31, 2023) adopted the first set of European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) requiring companies to provide comprehensive and robust information about social and environmental impacts, risks and opportunities to a broad group of stakeholders. The new standards seek to support the European Green Deal by making available relevant, consistent, and comparable data under a new reporting framework, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).
The release of the new disclosure rules by the Commission comes only five weeks after the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) released its inaugural sustainability disclosure standards. Both sets of rules, while representing substantially different perspectives on the core concept of materiality signal an unprecedented level of awareness globally of the urgency of addressing and seeking to mitigate the unfolding climate crisis. Yet the scope of ESRS extends far beyond the topic of climate change – in line with the EU’s broad environmental and social commitments under the sustainable growth strategy. Will the new disclosure rules deliver on the lofty expectations? Will they contribute to guiding and accelerating companies’ sustainability programmes – or lock valuable resource in into ever more complex reporting efforts? Is the level of harmonization achieved sufficient to offset the burden of more ambitious disclosures?
Can disclosure rules drive sustainability performance?
The new disclosure rules define what qualitative and quantitative information companies should make available, demanding transparency around sustainability targets and metrics, and accountability for sustainability governance, business strategy and, critically, sustainability due diligence. This will inform investor decisions, as well choices made by employees, consumers, and business partners. Increased transparency and accountability are ultimately expected to drive improved sustainability performance.
This also applies to one of the core concepts in ESRS: sustainability due diligence, which guides companies in identifying, preventing, mitigating, and accounting for how they address actual and potential adverse impacts. While ESRS does not impose conduct rules, it sets out the information to be made available about the due diligence process.
Will investors have access to relevant, consistent, and comparable data?
The lack of access to reliable data is widely viewed as a key obstacle in sustainable finance. While the new disclosure rules seek to address this, they should not be expected to generate large volumes of immediately comparable data from the start. Both IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards and ESRS include a large amount of narrative and descriptive indicators that require further analysis. Digital taxonomies are currently under development under both frameworks to help identify and extract comparable data efficiently.
Whether most disclosures should be mandatory or subject to a company’s own materiality assessment was arguably the most contentious aspect in the finalization of ESRS. The European Commission’s decision to remove climate change and certain workforce issues from the original list of mandatory disclosures has been met with criticism from investors dependent on this data to comply with ambitious reporting obligations under separate EU laws.
It remains to be seen whether the Commission’s resolution to subject all disclosure requirements, except for those specified under a cross-cutting ‘General Disclosures’ standard, to a company’s materiality assessment will effectively support transparency and accountability while also reducing costs. Feedback submitted by companies and business associations reflected both concerns over resource-intense materiality assessments as well as, on the opposite front, relief over the drastic reduction of mandatory disclosures.
First disclosures under CSRD, applying the new ESRS, will have to be made already for financial year 2024 in reporting year 2025 (see below, CSRD: Applicability and implementation timeline). The new disclosure frameworks will therefore be relevant immediately to large companies, but their reach will extend far beyond that over time and should support deep market coverage of sustainability data. Coverage of the new EU rules will gradually expand, from an initial 11,500 companies to nearly 50,000 from 2026. Importantly, both ESRS and ISSB standards apply a value-chain approach to sustainability disclosures. The phase-in provisions put in place under both regimes in recognition of the resource burden for SMEs will delay the knock-on effect of disclosure requirements passed on to small suppliers and other business partners.
What level of harmonization has been achieved?
Work on the new standards has not only been guided by the objective to harmonize, but has also been accompanied by significant consolidation efforts. The architecture of the globally endorsed standard for climate change-related disclosures developed by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) informs the structure of both ESRS and the ISSB standards, providing a foundation for interoperability. The TCFD recommendations have been fully integrated into the climate change-related disclosure standards, ESRS E1 and IFRS S2. From January 2024, the ISSB will take on the TCFD’s monitoring responsibilities, signaling an important milestone in harmonization efforts. This comes after the consolidation under the ISSB of the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) and the Value Reporting Foundation (VRF), which in turn incorporating the Integrated Reporting Framework and the SASB Standards.
EFRAG signed a cooperation agreement with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) to support “sustainability reporting convergence”. ESRS also incorporates the key concepts of foundational responsible business conduct guidance frameworks, the UN Guiding Principles and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, next to principles based on international conventions, e.g., ILO Conventions, and EU law. Going forward, it will be critical to ensure a high level of interoperability and alignment between the new disclosure frameworks to deliver on the commitment that harmonization will over time outweigh the cost of more comprehensive reporting.
Priorities: where to start?
Strengthen sustainability governance
Disclosures around procedures, controls and practices for the oversight and management of sustainability matters are central elements of both ESRS and the ISSB’s standards. Information requirements about sustainability skills and competencies on committees and boards as well as the integration of sustainability-related performance in incentive schemes are likely to prove particularly challenging. Only 12% of S&P500 companies have at least one board member with climate change-related skills according to ISS Data, while 23% of them disclose the use of climate-related metrics in their incentive plans for executives.[1] The new disclosure rules will increase scrutiny of boards’ ability to determine the adequacy of such metrics and to monitor and evaluate performance against them.
Determine materiality
The information to be disclosed is largely based on a company’s materiality assessment under both ESRS and the ISSB’s standards. Nearly 85% of European large and mid-cap companies disclosed they had carried out a sustainability materiality assessment, according to ISS Data. That compares with 52% in North America. For small-cap companies, that drops to 62% in Europe and 24% in North America.[2] Companies already providing these disclosures will have a head-start, but they will still have to substantially adapt and expand their efforts to identify and assess salient sustainability issues under the new disclosure rules. The “double materiality” approach underpinning the EU framework demands companies identify and evaluate both their impact on people and the environment and the effect on their financial performance through engagement with stakeholders and experts, and on the basis of scientific research and scenario analysis.
Embed sustainability in business strategy
Sustainability is no longer managed in isolation but should be an integral part of long-term strategic planning. As a result, sustainability disclosures should be aligned with financial disclosures. Both ESRS and IFRS S1 emphasize the importance of connectivity between sustainability disclosures and financial statements and require the integration of sustainability disclosures in financial reports. Specifically, CSRD-compliant sustainability statements, based on the requirements set out in the ESRS and incorporating EU Taxonomy disclosures, must be integrated into the company’s management report.
Look out for what is coming next
The release of the new sustainability disclosure frameworks signals monumental progress in the harmonization efforts in which key stakeholders globally participated over several years. It holds the promise of accelerating sustainable economic development through the availability of better data. But there is much work ahead. Both EFRAG and ISSB confirmed their commitment to deliver comprehensive guidance and tools, including the relevant digital taxonomies, to support implementation. Even so, the new frameworks will require major investments in developing technical expertise at all levels around individual sustainability topics, and in enhanced data gathering and reporting capabilities.
EU policymakers are not satisfied that disclosure rules alone will be sufficient to support the social and environmental commitments under the European Green Deal and the Sustainable Development Goals. A proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, CS-triple-D, seeks to introduce rules of conduct, or due diligence obligations to prevent and mitigate the most harmful effects of business activities both within and outside the European Union. While discussions between EU institutions about certain aspects of the proposal are still ongoing, this very process has contributed to increasing awareness about the need for connecting the dots: core pieces in the large body of international conventions, global commitments and standards that this regulatory initiative is anchored in have been around for a decade or more.
The first half of 2023 has seen an unprecedented acceleration of regulatory and standard setting activity, all signs suggest that this will continue throughout the remainder of the year. By the end of this year, we expect to have a clearer picture of the global corporate sustainability project and how to measure and report on its progress going forward.

"August 9, 2023",Rio Tinto to Supply Iron Ore to H2 Green Steel for Low Carbon Steel Production,"Rio Tinto, the world’s largest iron ore producer, announced a new partnership with Swedish low-carbon steel startup H2 Green Steel, including a new multi-year agreement for the supply of high grade direct reduction iron ore pellets from Rio Tinto’s Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) operations for H2 Green Steel’s low-carbon steel production plant in Boden, Sweden.
Founded in 2020, H2 Green Steel is building the world’s first large-scale fossil-free steel plant in Boden, with the project including a giga-scale green hydrogen plant as an integrated part of the steel production facility. The company employs hydrogen produced using green power to remove the oxygen from iron oxide, avoiding most of the CO2 emissions normally produced, and uses electricity from 100% renewable sources for the energy requirements generated in the manufacturing process. H2 Green Steel aims to begin production in 2025, with plans to produce 5 million tons of nearly fossil-free steel by 2030.
The companies said that IOC’s pellets will account for a significant part of H2 Green Steel’s iron ore supply. Under the new agreement, Rio Tinto will also purchase and on-sell surplus low carbon hot briquetted iron (HBI) from H2 Green Steel produced during the ramp-up of its steelmaking capacity.
H2 Green Steel CEO Henrik Henriksson said:
“This is a significant milestone for our project in Boden. Not only by securing a supply of the high-quality iron ore needed for our green steel production, but also because we have a buyer for a portion of the HBI we initially expect to produce. Rio Tinto is a global leader in the mining industry and we welcome its concrete actions to accelerate the decarbonisation of the steel industry.”
Demand for low carbon steel is expected to increase significantly, over the next several years, as manufacturers globally aim to decarbonize their supply chains. Steelmaking is one of the biggest emitters of CO2 globally, and one of the more challenging sectors to abate, with total greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the sector accounting for 7% – 9% of direct emissions from the global use of fossil fuels.
Rio Tinto has set climate goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% by 2025 and 50% by 2030, and to achieve net zero by 2050. The agreement with H2 Green Steel follows the launch by Rio Tinto in June of a partnership with China Baowu, the world’s largest steelmaker, aimed at decarbonizing the steel value chain, and focused on a series of projects in China and Australia.
Rio Tinto Head of Steel Decarbonisation Simon Farry said:
“We are partnering across the steel ecosystem to find better ways to support the decarbonisation of iron and steel making, and to reduce our scope 3 emissions. Our supply of high-grade iron ore pellets will support the acceleration of H2 Green Steel’s project, and on-selling their low-carbon HBI will enable us to gain a deeper understanding of the future needs of our customers and end users in the emerging green iron and steel market.”",COMPANIES/ ENERGY TRANSITION/ ENVIRONMENT,ESGTODAY
"August 9, 2023",S&P Removes ESG Indicators from Credit Rating Reports,"Credit ratings agency S&P Global Ratings announced that it will no longer include its ESG credit indicators, aimed at summarizing for investors the relevance of ESG factors on its credit analysis, in its reports on rated entities.
S&P introduced the alphanumeric ESG credit indicators in September 2021, outlining the influence of various ESG-related factors such as climate risk or transparency on its credit rating analysis on a 1 (positive)-to-5 (strongly negative) scale. At the time, S&P said that the indicators will not affect their credit ratings, but were instead meant to supplement the qualitative insights on the impact of the ESG factors on creditworthiness in its credit ratings reports.
In its statement announcing the change, S&P stated that it has “determined that the dedicated analytical narrative paragraphs in our credit rating reports are most effective at providing detail and transparency on ESG credit factors material to our rating analysis,” adding that these “remain integral to our reports.”
Last year, S&P Global was subject to an investigation by Republican attorneys general in several U.S. states, launched by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt and forming part of a broader anti-ESG campaign, alleging that the company’s ESG evaluations, including its ESG credit indicators, were politicizing financial analysis.
ESG ratings providers have also come under scrutiny over the past several months by regulators globally over the transparency and consistency of their ratings. In June, for example, the EU Commission unveiled a proposal for ESG ratings providers to be supervised by European markets regulator ESMA, to ensure quality and reliability, and last month the UK’s FCA announced the launch of a draft voluntary Code of Conduct for ESG ratings and data providers.
Despite the removal of its ESG credit indicators, S&P said that the move will not affect its ESG principles criteria, or its commentary on ESG-related topics, including on the influence of ESG factors on creditworthiness.","ESG TOOLS, SERVICES",ESGTODAY

"August 8, 2023",Goldman Sachs Invests in Renewable Natural Gas Platform Synthica,"Energy transition platform Synthica Energy announced that it has closed an equity investment from Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s Infrastructure Business, and a partnership with the investor aimed at scaling its renewable natural gas (RNG) production operations across U.S. hubs.
RNG, or biomethane, is expected to play a critical role in the transition to cleaner energy sources, particularly for sectors in which energy solutions such as wind or solar are less practical. RNG is typically produced from organic waste, such as agricultural, industrial, and household wastes, and is chemically identical to fossil-based natural gas, enabling it to support the decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors such as road transport and heavy industry, without needing to replace existing transmission and distribution infrastructure.
In addition to providing the benefits of fossil gas without its carbon emissions, RNG also helps avoid methane emissions that would be released through the decomposition of organic waste.
Founded in 2017, Ohio-based Synthica produces RNG from pre- consumer food and beverage waste and other organic manufacturing byproducts through anaerobic digestion. By utilizing pre-consumer waste, the company avoids challenges of post-consumer waste-based RNG production methods, including varying supply and contamination levels, enabling greater efficiency and consistency in the production of RNG. The company also noted that it provides a circular solution by enabling the repurposing of pre-organic waste that might otherwise end up in a landfill and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.
Synthica said that the investment will support the growth of its infrastructure projects and accelerate the development of facilities in key U.S. markets including Ohio, Texas, Georgia, Kentucky, and Louisiana in the near term. The company also plans to develop facilities in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, New York, and Pennsylvania.
Sam Schutte, CEO of Synthica, said:
“Synthica’s mission is to provide a critical service for hard-to-process organic waste streams, divert these materials away from landfills and other non-sustainable disposal outlets, and ultimately reduce carbon and methane emissions. We are excited about partnering with Goldman Sachs since it will enable us to accelerate our project development pipeline, enhance our circular solutions for our customers, and supply RNG to meet the growing market demand.”
The announcement marks the latest biofuels-focused investment by Goldman Sachs. Earlier this year, the firm launched a new investment platform, Verdalia Bioenergy, aimed at capitalizing on biomethane investment opportunities in Europe, with plans to deploy more than €1 billion over the next four years.
Cedric Lucas, Managing Director in the Infrastructure Business within Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said:
“Similar to our Verdalia investment in Europe focused on biomethane, we believe this sustainable process can provide dual benefits, helping businesses and municipalities beneficially reuse their organic waste and supplying the country’s utilities with RNG, critical for reducing their carbon footprints.”",ENERGY TRANSITION/ INVESTORS,ESGTODAY
"August 8, 2023","Mitsubishi, Suntory and ENEOS to Launch Biomass-Based PET Bottle Supply Chain","Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi Corporation, announced an agreement with consumer goods company Suntory Holding Ltd, and energy company ENEOS Corporation aimed at building a supply chain for the production of sustainable PET plastic bottles to be made from biomass.
According to Mitsubishi, the companies expect to produce bio-paraxylene (bio-PX) equivalent to approximately 35 million PET bottles, to be used as a raw material for Suntory’s sustainable PET bottles in 2024.
Mitsubishi will oversee the supply chain which starts with renewable fuel supplier NESTE supplying bio-based feedstock derived from 100% renewable sources like used cooking oil, replacing fossil-based naphtha.
ENEOS will produce bio-PX at its Mizushima Refinery using the bio-naphtha as the starting material, and the bio-PX will be used to manufacture bio-high purity terephthalic acid (PTA) and bio-PET bottles. Suntory will then incorporate bio-PET resin into the production of sustainable PET bottles for its products.
According to Mitsubishi, this will be the first time sustainable PET bottles have been produced using bio-PX derived from bio-naphtha on a commercial scale, with the development of the new supply chain contributing to the reduction of CO2 emissions, compared to conventional petroleum-derived product.
In a statement announcing the agreement, Mitsubishi said:
“We believe the usage of biomass for PET bottles, together with further development of the recycling system, will play an important role in the realization of a low-carbon and decarbonized society as well as in reducing dependency on fossil resources.”",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT,ESGTODAY
"August 8, 2023",Sustainable Chemicals Startup Dioxycle Raises $17 Million,"Cleantech startup Dioxycle announced that it has raised $17 million, with proceeds from the Series A funding round aimed at advancing its technology to transform CO2 emissions into high-value sustainable chemicals.
Founded in 2021, French-American Dioxycle is developing a technology that uses a low-temperature electrolyzer to produce sustainable ethylene from recycled carbon emissions, water, and renewable electricity.
Ethylene is the world’s most widely consumed organic chemical and is integral to industries like textiles, plastics, construction, and furniture. The conventional conversion process uses fossil fuels and is responsible for substantial carbon emissions.  According to Dioxcycle, its approach delivers the most cost-efficient ethylene and commodity chemical production process, which the company estimates could cut annual CO2 emissions by 800 million—over 2% of the world’s total—by shifting from fossil fuels in ethylene production.
Sarah Lamaison, co-founder and CEO of Dioxycle, said:
“To reach our climate goals, we must disrupt the processes of incumbents instead of re-building the industry from the ground up. Leveraging existing industrial assets will allow us to scale sustainable technologies at the required speed.”
Dioxycle said that it will use the new funding to support its first on-site demonstrators, an industrial prototype, and eventual preliminary commercialization within five years.
David Wakerley, co-founder and CTO of Dioxycle, said:
“Given how much our society runs on carbon, CO2 emissions could be considered an incredible resource, but only with a highly efficient CO2-conversion technology to take advantage of them. Now, we are ready to build an electrolyzer with the carbon-converting capabilities of about 20,000 trees, focused on the production of sustainable ethylene.”

"August 8, 2023",Guest Post: Five Steps Small Businesses Can Take Toward Sustainability,"By: Rob Fisher, KPMG U.S. ESG Leader
The journey toward understanding the importance of environmental, social and governance (ESG) is often sparked by personal experiences and connections. In my case, my daughter’s passion for environmentalism made all the difference in my own awareness of the challenges we face. However, as we all delve deeper into this topic, it becomes clear that ESG is about so much more than just protecting the environment — it’s ultimately about financial viability. Our mission is to help organizations realize the financial value embedded in ESG to unearth a more resilient business that will thrive in a low-carbon economy.
Large organizations are increasingly subject to an array of ESG reporting obligations. Incentivized by grants and tax credits, these large companies are driving the move toward sustainability. However, it’s the small and mid-sized companies that make up nearly 90% of businesses worldwide and employ almost half of North America’s workers. Therefore, it is crucial to explore how sustainability wins from small businesses can snowball into the larger value chain.
To build a loyal customer base and differentiate their business in the market, creating value and preserving sustainability are essential considerations for small businesses. They can start by adopting energy efficiency measures and renewable energy sources to reduce their carbon footprint and lower operating costs, creating long-term value through energy savings. To preserve sustainability, small businesses can implement waste reduction and recycling programs and support responsible supply chains by sourcing materials and products from ethical and sustainable suppliers.
Here are five ways that small businesses can build and execute an ESG strategy without incurring significant costs:
Start small. Small businesses can take small steps toward ESG by beginning to inventory their emissions, eliminating single-use plastics and adopting eco-friendly products or services. These steps can be taken without significant financial investment and build momentum toward a larger ESG strategy.
Engage employees. Encourage employee participation in events such as an environmental speaker series or annual paid volunteer day to support a local nonprofit. Making a charitable contribution to a local nonprofit that employees nominate or subsidizing mass transit fees for employees are other examples of ways to engage employees and create awareness of a business’s ESG strategy.
Collaborate. Small businesses can collaborate with other companies or organizations in their community to share resources and ideas for implementing ESG practices. This can reduce the costs of implementing ESG practices and build relationships with like-minded organizations.
Leverage technology. There are many low-cost or free technology solutions available that can help small businesses monitor their energy usage, reduce paper waste or track their carbon footprint. For example, some utility companies offer free energy monitoring tools to their customers, which can be accessed through websites or mobile apps.
Communicate ESG efforts. Finally, small businesses should communicate their ESG efforts to their stakeholders, including customers, investors and employees. While they may not be subject to the same reporting requirements as their public counterparts, transparent disclosures can build trust and credibility and encourage others to adopt similar practices. To effectively communicate their ESG efforts and progress, small businesses can adopt approaches tailored to their size and resources. For example, a small retail business may prioritize sustainable sourcing, waste reduction and community engagement as key material items aligned with its strategy. The results can be showcased through various channels, including the company website, social media platforms, customer newsletters and local community engagement. Sharing success stories and metrics related to ESG efforts can enhance awareness among stakeholders.
This is a critical time for small businesses to recognize that sustainability and environmental responsibility are not necessarily an added cost or compliance burden but an opportunity to create significant financial value for the organization and thrive during the transition to a low-carbon economy.",COMPANIES/ GUEST POSTS,ESGTODAY
"August 8, 2023","New Zealand, BlackRock Launch $1.2 Billion Climate Infrastructure Fund to Accelerate Energy Transition Goals","The Government of New Zealand and investment giant BlackRock announced today the launch of a new NZ$2 billion (USD$1.2 billion) fund aimed at investing in New Zealand’s climate infrastructure.
In a statement announcing the launch, the government said that the goal of the fund is support New Zealand’s ambition to be one of the first countries in the world to reach 100% renewable energy. The fund will include investments from private sector funds, as well as New Zealand crown companies and superannuation funds.
According to Minister of Energy and Resources Megan Woods, the new fund will enable businesses to access pools of capital for investments in cleantech and infrastructure to accelerate the country’s emissions reductions, including areas such as battery storage, wind and solar generation, green hydrogen production and electric vehicle chargers.
Woods added:
“The projects funded through investment in the New Zealand net zero Fund will not only decarbonise our energy use, but will also create highly-skilled jobs here in New Zealand, and opportunities to grow New Zealand companies.”
The launch of the fund follows the release last year by the government of its Emission Reduction plan to address climate change and the country’s transition to a low emissions economy. Key initiatives in the plan included setting a target for 50% of total final energy consumption to come from renewable sources by 2035, and to develop energy strategies for a net zero economy in 2050. New Zealand has also set an aspirational goal to reach 100% renewable electricity by 2030.
Prime Minister Chris Hipkins called the fund “a game changer for the clean tech sector,” that will “super charge investments in clean technology that might otherwise not have happened.”
Hipkins added:
“With countries around the world experiencing the impacts of climate change on a daily basis, it’s never been more urgent to invest in technology that will help address the climate crisis, and New Zealand is well positioned to be a home for that investment.”
According to BlackRock, the fund marks the firm’s largest single country decarbonization-focused project to date. In a statement announcing the launch of the fund, BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink said:
“New Zealand doesn’t just have the ambition to build a more resilient energy system and be a leader in decarbonization globally. It is already doing that today. As we approach COP28 at the end of this year, the world is looking for models of cooperation between the private and public sectors to ensure an orderly, just, and fair energy transition. Building on BlackRock’s Climate Finance Partnership fund announced at COP26 in Glasgow, the New Zealand climate infrastructure strategy can be a model for how to scale and implement this vision.”",ENERGY TRANSITION/ GOVERNMENT/ INVESTORS,ESGTODAY
"August 7, 2023",LSEG Partners with Siglar to Enable Shippers to Integrate Carbon Cost into Shipping Decisions,"The London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) announced an agreement with maritime emissions analytics company Siglar Carbon, aimed at enabling companies to evaluate lower carbon options for shipping, utilizing LSEG’s data, news, analytics and productivity tool Workspace.
According to LEG, the new collaboration comes as the EU prepares to expand the Emissions Trading System (ETS), its cap and trade carbon pricing program, to include the maritime shipping sector. The EU recently announced plans to include new sectors, including shipping, in the ETS, beginning January 2024, creating increased costs for owners, charterers and traders that fail to factor in costs of carbon emissions.
According to analysis by the companies, carbon emission costs for traders and charterers could be reduced by as much as 50% by choosing carbon-efficient ships and route planning.
Fabrice Maille, Head of Shipping & Agriculture at LSEG, said:
“When trading physical commodities, it is vital to have the right data and insights when evaluating the different options for cargo programmes to cut emissions. For traders and charterers, this could halve carbon emissions costs.
“There are already ongoing efforts to decarbonise focusing on aspects such fuels but given how quickly the ETS will come into force, planning carbon-efficient voyages is low hanging fruit logistically.”
Norway-base Siglar provides utilizes big data and analytics to provide insights to reduce CO2 emissions in the shipping industry. The new agreement will combine Siglar’s emissions insights with carbon markets and industry emissions analytics to help users understand, predict and improve the carbon footprint of commercial shipping decisions and control the related carbon cost exposure, with data enabling them to locate the most carbon-efficient shipping alternative.
Sigmund Kyvik, Siglar Carbon CEO, said:
“Our carbon solutions already play a pivotal role in driving decarbonisation in the shipping industry. Through LSEG, we can capitalise on its unique position and scale of its Workspace platform to bring our insights to a wider audience.”","ENVIRONMENT/ ESG TOOLS, SERVICES",ESGTODAY

"August 7, 2023",Over Half of M&A Dealmakers Have Cancelled Deals on ESG Due Diligence Findings: KPMG Survey,"ESG considerations are increasingly being integrated into the dealmaking process by M&A professionals, according to a new survey by global professional services firm KPMG, which found that over half of respondents reported that they have cancelled deals due to material findings during ESG due diligence, and that nearly two thirds of investors would pay a premium for companies aligned with their ESG priorities.
For the study, KPMG surveyed 200 U.S. ESG practitioners including corporate investors, financial investors, and M&A debt providers.
The survey found that three quarters (74%) of professionals are already integrating ESG considerations as part of their M&A agenda, with the identification of ESG risks and opportunities given as the top reason for conducting ESG due diligence, by 46% of respondents, followed by requirements by investors, cited by 19%, and preparation for regulatory requirements by 14%.
KPMG U.S. ESG and Climate Services Leader Mark Golovcsenko, said:
“The data speaks loud and clear: Companies and investors are increasingly integrating ESG considerations into their M&A strategies, not only because it’s the right and responsible thing to do but also because of the value implications of ESG.”
The survey examined the potential impacts of findings in the ESG due diligence process, with more than half of respondents indicating that red flags on ESG could be a deal stopper (51%) or result in additional closing conditions (52%), and 44% saying it could result in a valuation reduction. 53% of respondents said that material ESG due diligence findings have resulted in deal cancellations, and 42% said that they have resulted in purchase price reductions.
While adverse material findings have impacted or cancelled deals, the study also found that over 60% of investors would be willing to pay a premium for targets that demonstrate high levels of ESG maturity and that align with their own ESG priorities. Of these, more than a third said that the premium amount could exceed 5%.
The study also indicated that the frequency of ESG due diligence is expected to increase going forward. 72% of investors indicated that they will conduct ESG due diligence on more than 20% of deals in the future, compared to 56% who have done so in the past 2 years, including 27% who expect to conduct ESG due diligence on more than 80% of deals, compared to only 16% who have done so over the past 2 years.
The survey also examined the key challenges facing professionals conducting ESG due diligence, with a lack of robust data reported as a top challenge by 59% of respondents. 56% also reported difficulty in selecting a meaningful scope for ESG due diligence, 56% said that there was an inadequate understanding of what ESG due diligence means across stakeholders, and 45% reported difficulties in quantifying their findings.
KPMG U.S. Partner, ESG Clare Lunn said:
“As the world continues to evolve, so do the expectations of businesses. Our latest ESG Due Diligence Survey reveals an undeniable truth: Sustainable practices are no longer just a choice but a prerequisite for resilience and growth.”","M&A/ REPORTS, STUDIES",ESGTODAY

"August 3, 2023",UK to Create IFRS-Based Sustainability Disclosure Standards,"The UK government unveiled plans to create UK Sustainability Disclosure Standards (SDS), for companies to use to report on sustainability and climate related risks, according to a new statement by the Department for Business and Trade (DBT). The DBT said that the standards will form the basis for any future sustainability reporting legislation or regulation.
According to the DBT, the new standards will be based on the recently published sustainability and climate-related reporting standards issued by the IFRS Foundation’s International Sustainability Standards Board. The ISSB was launched in November 2021 at the UK-hosted COP26 climate conference, with the goal to develop IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, driven by demand from investors, companies, governments and regulators to provide a global baseline of disclosure requirements enabling a consistent understanding of the effect of sustainability risks and opportunities on companies’ prospects.
The IFRS standards were published in June 2023, and in July, IOSCO, the leading international policy forum and standards setter for securities regulators called on regulators to incorporate the standards into their sustainability reporting regulatory frameworks.
In its statement, the DBT said that it will base the UK SDS on the IFRS standards in order to ensure that sustainability disclosures by UK companies are globally comparable and useful for investors, with the UK rules diverting from the global baseline only if absolutely necessary for UK-specific matters.
The statement said:
“By using the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards as a baseline, the aim is for the information companies disclose under UK SDS to be globally comparable and decision-useful for investors. The disclosures required by these standards will help investors to compare information between companies, thereby aiding decision making; supporting the efficient allocation of capital, and smooth running of the UK’s capital markets.”
The plan to launch the UK SDS follows the update earlier this year of the UK’s Green Finance Strategy, which included a pledge to assess the new IFRS sustainability and climate-related reporting standards once they are published.
The DBT added that decisions to require disclosures will be taken independently by the UK government and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). In 2021, the UK announced plans to require mandatory climate-related reporting for large companies, and in its updated Green Finance Strategy the government said that it would consult on requirements for large companies to disclose climate transition plans.
The DBT statement said that the Secretary of State for Business and Trade will consider the endorsement of the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, to create UK SDS by July 2024.",ESG REPORTING/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY
"August 3, 2023",CVC Commits to Have Private Equity Portfolio Companies Set Science-Based Climate Targets,"Global alternative investment manager CVC Capital Partners announced a new series of new climate-related goals for its own operations and investment portfolio, including a commitment for all eligible companies in its private equity and listed equity portfolio to have Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)-validated emissions reduction targets set by 2035.
The new goals, unveiled in CVC’s 2023 ESG Report, include an interim commitment for 40% of listed and private equity investments to have SBTI-validated targets by 2027, and for the CVC to reduce its own absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 73% by 2030, on a 2019 base year.
CVC said that the new targets have been set and validated with the SBTi.
In the report, CVC Head of ESG Chloë Sanders said:
“This year’s confirmation from the Science Based Targets initiative that our targets have been verified was a major milestone for us. It will catalyse tangible decarbonisation in our portfolio with a focus on our private equity investments where we have most influence. With a private equity portfolio of over 100 companies, more than half a million employees across the globe, and AUM of over €85bn, it’s going to be a busy time ahead!”
Scope 3 emissions, particularly those from its investment portfolio, represent the vast majority of CVC’s emissions footprint. The company said that it will support its portfolio companies in measuring emissions and setting decarbonization roadmaps, highlighting engagement efforts through projects including the GHG Foundations Project, which helps companies collect emissions data, develop a plan to support ongoing data collection and reporting and prepare for carbon accounting, and the Climate Action Accelerator Project, to model emissions reductions in line with science-based targets, develop action plans and a business case for decarbonization, and submit targets to the SBTi.
Eligible companies covered by the portfolio target include those in which CVC holds more than a 25% ownership stake and a board seat, and with more than 24 months since date of acquisition. The target covers nearly 60% of CVC’s investment and lending activities, with credit and secondaries holdings representing over 35%. In the report, CVC noted that credit and secondaries are at an earlier stage, with the current focus primarily on implementing processes to gather credible emissions data. Currently, fewer than 10% of eligible companies have SBTI-validated targets, according to the report.
In the report, CVC ESG Committee co-Chairs Jean-Remy Roussel and Chris Stadler said:
“Proactively incorporating ESG will help future proof companies and meaningfully contribute to our objective of creating long-term sustainable value.”
In order to reach its emissions goals covering its own operations, CVC said that it will purchase renewable energy, electrify its fleet and consider energy efficiency in new leases. The company noted that it has already significantly reduced its Scope 2 emissions through renewable energy purchases, primarily using Energy Attribute Certificates. Over the past year, CVC said that it purchased Energy Attribute Certificates covering 962 MWh of energy used.",ENVIRONMENT/ INVESTORS/ PRIVATE EQUITY,ESGTODAY

The mill is expected to take 22 months to construct, and is anticipated to produce 630,000 tons of rebar annually. The mill technology is being supplied by metal industry plant construction and mechanical engineering company SMS Group.
The company said that it has also become the first steel company globally to be certified to issue Climate Bonds, which demonstrate compliance with the international Paris Agreement’s GHG emissions targets.
Hybar CEO Dave Stickler said:
“The Climate Bond certification aligns perfectly with Hybar’s plan to offer our customers competitively priced rebar that is also the greenest rebar in the market.”
The equity portion of the financing  was led by TPG Rise Climate, the $7 billion climate investing strategy of TPG’s global impact investing platform, TPG Rise, and Global Principal Partners, the investment entity used by Hybar’s senior management team.
Of the proceeds raised, $470 million will be used to build the mill, with the remainder used to start up and operate the mill and pay certain debt service costs during construction.
TPG Partner Mike Stone said:
“Our investment in Hybar not only reflects the trust we have in this talented management team but our thematic focus on sustainable materials broadly, and on green steel production specifically. The global steel industry accounts for 7-9% of global CO2 emissions today, which creates a massive opportunity for Hybar to drive decarbonization at scale.”",ENERGY TRANSITION/ ENVIRONMENT/ PRIVATE EQUITY,ESGTODAY

"August 2, 2023",Biden Administration Announces New Sustainable Procurement Rules for Federal Government,"The Biden administration announced today the release of a new Sustainable Products and Services procurement rule, with requirements for federal government buyers to prioritize sustainable products and services, and expanding the categories of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Ecolabel standards for federal purchasing to a series of new sectors.
The new proposal forms part of the administration’s Federal Sustainability Plan, launched by President Biden in December 2021, which outlines a series of goals and initiatives for the U.S. federal government to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and including a target to cut emissions from federal procurement to net zero by that date.
The U.S. government is the world’s largest buyer of goods and services, with purchases reaching $630 billion last year. According to a White House statement announcing the new proposal, increasing purchases of sustainable products and services will help the government reduce its supply chain emissions, which are responsible for more than twice the emissions of its 300,000 buildings and 600,000 vehicles combined.
Brenda Mallory, Chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said:
“President Biden believes that when we spend American taxpayers’ dollars, we should be investing in America, reducing costs, and building a more sustainable future. Through today’s action, we are doing just that. Combined with President Biden’s Buy American directive, our proposed rule will boost Federal agency purchases of EPA-recommended green products and services while creating well-paying jobs and investing in American manufacturing.”
The new proposed rule would update the government’s Federal Acquisition Regulation to focus on environmental and sustainability matters, and to require federal agencies to purchase sustainable products and services “to the maximum extent practicable,” that is unless the agency cannot competitively acquire a product or service within a reasonable performance schedule, or one that meets reasonable performance requirements or can be acquired at a reasonable price.
Under the proposal, agencies would be directed to follow EPA’s Recommendations of Specifications, Standards, and Ecolabels for Federal Purchasing, designed to help government purchasers identify private sector standards and ecolabels that meet sustainable acquisition goals and mandates. Alongside the launch of the new proposed rules, the EPA announced that it will extend its recommendations to new product and services categories including healthcare, professional services, laboratories, uniforms and clothing, and food service ware.
The new rules would also direct agencies to avoid the procurement of products containing PFAS, or “forever chemicals.” PFAS are a group of chemicals that have been in use in a wide range of consumer and industrial products since the 1940s. They are commonly found in food packaging, fabrics, kitchenware products, fire-fighting foam, and electronics, among other products. The chemicals tend to be very persistent, and don’t break down over time, and have been found to accumulate in the human body and in the environment. It is believed that PFAS can have cause adverse health effects in humans, including low birth weights, cancers, thyroid hormone disruption as well as affecting the immune system.
EPA Administrator Michael Regan said:
“By catalyzing federal sustainable procurement, consumers benefit from goods and services that are safer for both their families and our planet. This proposed rule builds on other bold efforts by the Biden-Harris Administration to prioritize responsible, sustainable trade and reduce pollution at its source.”",ENVIRONMENT/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY
"August 1, 2023","ANA Signs 30,000 Tonne Carbon Removal Agreement","Japan’s All Nippon Airways (ANA) announced today an agreement to purchase 30,000 carbon dioxide removal (CDR) credits from energy company Occidental’s (Oxy), carbon capture, utilization and sequestration platform subsidiary, 1PointFive.
The deal follows the announcement last year by Oxy and 1PointFive of plans to build the world’s largest to date direct air capture (DAC) plant, “Stratos,” in the Texas Permian Basin, with capacity to capture up to 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year at launch, and the potential to scale up to 1 million tons. The new plant is anticipated to be operational in mid-2025.
DAC technology, listed by the IEA as a key carbon removal option in the transition to a net-zero energy system, extracts CO2 directly from the atmosphere for use as a raw material or permanently removed when combined with storage. According to last year’s IPCC climate change mitigation study, scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C include carbon dioxide removal methods scaling to billions of tons of removal annually over the coming decades, with DAC positioned to potentially account for a significant portion of the total.
Michael Avery, President of 1PointFive, said:
“Direct Air Capture is a vital and scalable carbon removal technology that is necessary to help society achieve net zero. We are proud that 1PointFive is able to support a leading airline like ANA in their purchase of our high-quality carbon removal credits to advance their climate strategy. The aviation industry can uniquely benefit from DAC as a pathway to removing carbon emissions securely, practically and on a large-scale.”
Under the new agreement, 1PointFive’s first with an airline, ANA will purchase 10,000 metric tonnes of CDR credits per year for three years enabled by Stratos, beginning in 2025. ANA has set a goal to achieve carbon neutrality in 2050, with its climate transition strategy focused on emissions reductions through operational and infrastructure improvements, sustainable aviation fuel, and removing residual emissions through Direct Air Capture.
Shinichi Inoue, President and CEO of ANA, said:
“Reaching our goal of carbon neutrality is one of the key priorities for ANA, and we are actively diversifying our methods to pursue sustainability. As we continue to review and invest in sustainable and innovative technologies and processes that help further our mission, we look forward to seeing the positive impact that partnering with 1PointFive brings to our airline.”",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT,ESGTODAY
"August 1, 2023",Steel Dynamics Signs Largest Ever North American Steel Industry Renewable Energy Deal,"US-based steel producer and metals recycler Steel Dynamics announced that it has signed a 308 MW Renewable Product Purchase Agreement (RPPA) with a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources, the largest of its kind to date for the North American steel industry.
Steelmaking is one of the biggest emitters of CO2 globally, with total greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the sector accounting for 7% – 9% of direct emissions from the global use of fossil fuels.
Steel Dynamics produces steel using electric arc furnace (EAF) technology, which uses recycled ferrous scrap as the primary raw material, and does not require the smelting of virgin iron ore or the burning of coal, generating substantially lower levels of carbon emissions with less energy intensity relative to traditional blast furnace steelmaking technology.
The new Texas-based windfarm, anticipated to be operational in 2024, is expected to produce approximately 1.1 million MWh of electricity annually, equivalent to 16% of Steel Dynamics’ annual electricity usage, enabling the company to exceed its goal to reach 10% renewable electricity by 2025, and move closer to its 2030 goal of 30%.
The goals were set in 2021, alongside a target by the company to achieve carbon neutrality in its electric arc furnace (EAF) steel mill operations by 2050.
Mark D. Millett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics, said:
“Steel Dynamics is already a leader in the production of lower-carbon steel products, with our steel mills’ greenhouse gas emissions among the lowest in the industry globally. This investment represents a significant step forward on our path to carbon neutrality. The steel industry is vital to a healthy manufacturing base and sustainable infrastructure, and we produce the steel required for a sustainable future.”
Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources, added:
“Large energy consumers, such as Steel Dynamics, are well suited to benefit from the development of large renewable energy projects. We are committed to leading the decarbonization of the U.S. economy, and meaningful collaborations like this will be key to meeting corporate, industry, and national carbon emissions reduction goals.”",COMPANIES/ ENERGY TRANSITION,ESGTODAY
"August 1, 2023",Lufthansa Signs Deal for Sustainable Aviation Fuel Made from Biogenic Residue,"Lufthansa Group and chemical solutions company HCS Group announced today a new agreement for the production and supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) beginning in 2026, from a planned new 60,000 metric tonne per year biogenic SAF facility.
The companies have signed a Letter of Intent (LoI) for the HCS Group to supply Lufthansa with SAF produced using Alcohol -to-Jet (AtJ) technology, which converts alcohols derived from residues from agriculture and forestry into an alternative jet fuel blendstock.
The SAF will be produced at the Haltermann Carless site in Speyer, Germany, with initial production volume estimated at 60,000 metric tons per year, anticipated to be the first large-scale producer of biogenic SAF in Germany.
Sustainable aviation fuel is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry, which currently accounts for 2-3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Demand for SAF is likely to rise dramatically over the next few years, as airlines turn to the technology as one of the key solutions to hit their climate goals, and as governments begin to mandate increased SAF use to achieve their own decarbonization ambitions. In May, for example, lawmakers at the European Parliament and EU Council announced an agreement on new rules requiring a minimum SAF share of fuel at EU airports, rising to 70% by 2050.
According to Lufthansa, the agreement underpins its goals to drive the market and ramp use of sustainable aviation fuels. The company has set a target to achieve a neutral CO2 balance by 2050, and an ambition to halve its net CO2 emissions by 2030, compared to 2019. Lufthansa Group is one of the largest SAF customers globally, and the company said that it expects to invest up to $250 million in SAF procurement over the coming years.",COMPANIES/ ENERGY TRANSITION,ESGTODAY

"August 1, 2023",Nearly Half of High Income Workers Consider Switching Jobs for a More Sustainable Company: Deloitte,"Nearly half of self-identified higher income respondents reported considering switching jobs to work for a more sustainable company, compared to only 13% of their lower income counterparts, according to a new study released by global professional services firm Deloitte, which found similar gaps in sustainability-focused consumption and political action by income classification, despite similar attitudes on climate change among the groups.
For the study “Economic uncertainty puts pressure on sustainable behavior change,” Deloitte collated results from surveys conducted between 2021 and 2023, including a survey of 24,000 respondents in 24 countries in March 2023, with a focus on sustainability-related behaviors in the home, workplace and community.
The results of the study found that respondents’ reports of changes to personal behavior to address climate change has declined recently, falling from 65% in September 2021 to 54% in March 2023, as multiple economic shocks including an energy crisis, inflation and job losses have impacted households, even though more than two thirds of respondents say that they believe climate change is an emergency, a proportion which has stayed relatively constant over the survey period.
One of the key findings of the study is the differences in willingness and ability between respondents in various self-identified income categories to act on their sustainability concerns and values. For example while similar proportions of respondents in the 2023 survey in higher-, middle-and lower-income groups reported that they believe climate change is an emergency (72% higher-income, 68% middle-income, and 65% lower-income), 59% of higher-income respondents said that they always or often choose sustainable products, compared to only 42% of lower-income and 44% of middle income respondents.
Higher cost appeared to be the main sustainable purchase differentiating factor, with 53% of lower income consumers citing cost as the main barrier to sustainable product purchases compared to only 32% of higher income respondents. Similarly, roughly 25% of higher income respondents said that they power their homes with renewable energy, around twice the percentage of lower- and middle-income respondents.
Leon Pieters, Global Consumer Industry leader, Deloitte Global, said:
“Our research highlights the troubling disconnect between concern and action on climate change for individuals, and the root causes of this gap. Most people agree climate change is a critical issue and want to take steps to address it, but too many are unable to do so amid rising costs, recession fears, geopolitical tensions, the long-term ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic, and more.”
Similar forces appear to drive workplace decisions, with 46% of higher income respondents reporting that they have considered switching jobs to work for a more sustainable company, more than twice the rate reported by middle income respondents (20%) and over three times that of the lower income group (13%). These findings come despite much higher sustainability-related workplace satisfaction by the higher income group, with 63% agreeing that their employer is doing enough to address climate change, compared to only 23% of lower income respondents who agree.
The study also found that those identifying as higher income are substantially more likely to engage in political and civic processes on sustainability-related issues, with 25% of lower income respondents reporting that that they have never contacted a public official about climate issues, compared to only 11% of their higher income counterparts, and 9% of lower income respondents reporting that they have donated to an environmental organization over the past year, compared to 24% of higher income respondents.
Jennifer Steinmann, Global Sustainability & Climate practice leader, Deloitte Global, said:
“It’s essential for global leaders to understand how and why people are taking climate action personally, at work, and in their communities, and why some are not able to take action to the extent they would like. Ultimately, the aggregated impact of individual decisions to live a more sustainable life does influence the efforts of companies and governments and can accelerate the broader, systemic action required to meet the ambition of the global emissions reduction goals set forth in the Paris Agreement.”

"July 31, 2023",EU Commission Adopts Final Sustainability Reporting Rules,"The European Commission announced today that it has adopted the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), the rules and requirements for companies to report on sustainability-related impacts, opportunities and risks under the EU’s upcoming Corporate Sustainable Reporting Directive (CSRD), marking a major step towards the implementation of the law, with reporting set to begin for some companies as soon as the 2024 financial year.
While welcoming the milestone announcement, sustainability-focused investor groups expressed concerns about the EU Commission’s recent move to ease several aspects of the new rules, in particular its removal of the mandatory nature of many of the CSRD’s sustainability disclosures, which remained in the adopted ESRS.
The CSRD, on track to begin applying from the beginning of 2024, is aimed as a major update to the 2014 Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), the current EU sustainability reporting framework. The new rules will significantly expand the number of companies required to provide sustainability disclosures to over 50,000 from around 12,000 currently, and introduce more detailed reporting requirements on company impacts on the environment, human rights and social standards and sustainability-related risk.
The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) was mandated by the European Commission in June 2020 to prepare new EU sustainability reporting standards, and in November 2022, EFRAG submitted its final ESRS draft, after modifying its initial drafts to ease the administrative burden on companies and reducing the number of reporting requirements by half.
In June 2023, the European Commission released a proposed version of the final ESRS, with a series of its own changes, most notably proposing that all disclosure requirements, with the exception of a set of general disclosures, be subject to materiality assessments, effectively allowing companies to focus reporting on sustainability factors that they consider material to their businesses. Additional changes included phasing in certain reporting requirements such as Scope 3 emissions and biodiversity-related topics and “own workforce” disclosures for companies with fewer than 750 employees in the first year that they apply the standards.
Following the June release, investment and finance groups expressed concerns with the EU Commissions’ amendments, stating that they would impact their ability to obtain sustainability-related information required for investment decisions, in addition to reducing their ability to meet their own reporting requirements including those under the EU’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).
In a statement released following the EU Commission’s adoption of the ESRS, Aleksandra Palinska, Executive Director of Eurosif, said:
“We regret that the investors’ calls to retain key ESG indicators as mandatory have not been heard. Investors need specific corporate disclosures to allocate capital in line with EU Climate Law and Green Deal objectives and to prepare their own sustainability-related disclosures.”
In an apparent attempt to ease investor concerns, the Commission published a Q&A following the adoption of the ESRS, which pointed out that “disclosure requirements subject to materiality are not voluntary,” adding that information must be disclosed if it is material, and that the materiality assessment process itself is subject to external assurance.
The Commission added:
“If a company concludes that climate change is not a material topic and therefore does not report in accordance with that standard, it has to provide a detailed explanation of the conclusions of its materiality assessment with regard to climate change. This requirement reflects the fact that climate change has wide-ranging and systemic impacts across the economy.”
The Commission also highlighted the high level of interoperability between the ESRS and other sustainability reporting standards of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), noting in particular that “companies that are required to report in accordance with ESRS on climate change will to a very large extent report the same information as companies that will use the ISSB standard on climate-related disclosures.”
Following the adoption of the new sustainability reporting rules, the Commission’s ESRS delegated act will be passed along to the EU Parliament and Council for a two-month scrutiny period, with each body able to reject, but not amend the act.
Once implemented, companies that were previously subject to the NFRD and large non-EU listed companies with more than 500 employees will be required to begin reporting under ESRS for financial year 2024, with the first reports to be issued in 2025, while other large companies starting a year later. Listed SMEs – including non-EU listed SMEs – will begin issuing their first ESRS sustainability statements in 2027, although they may decide to opt out for up to two years. The reporting requirements will also apply to non-EU companies that generate more than €150 million of revenue annually in the EU and that have a branch in the EU with revenue over €40 million or a subsidiary that is a large company or a listed SME, beginning with financial year 2028 with first reporting in 2029.
Mairead McGuinness, Commissioner for Financial Services, Financial Stability and Capital Markets Union, said:
“The standards we have adopted today are ambitious and are an important tool underpinning the EU’s sustainable finance agenda. They strike the right balance between limiting the burden on reporting companies while at the same time enabling companies to show the efforts they are making to meet the Green Deal Agenda, and accordingly have access to sustainable finance.”",ESG REPORTING/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY

"July 31, 2023",Guest Post: A Major Milestone in Our Quest for Net Zero,"By: Mike Hayes, Global Head of Climate Change & Decarbonization, KPMG
Last month, after months of planning and detailed negotiation, members of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) took a momentous step forward in our quest for a net-zero planet.
The organization, which was only founded in late 2021, has published its first sustainability reporting standards. You may argue we’ve been here before – with grand pledges and commitments from world leaders and internal bodies. On this occasion, we’re on the cusp of something different and far more decisive.
The ISSB’s actions – if adopted by enough jurisdictions – have the capacity to deliver real change for the world and move us significantly towards the shared goal of a more sustainable planet that fights back against the climate crisis.
In my role as KPMG’s Global Head of Climate Change and Decarbonization, I’ve attended COP summits and hundreds of other high-level meetings and sessions aimed at hammering out agreement on what we can do to genuinely tackle the world’s biggest challenge. Following COP26in Glasgow, I spoke of my confidence that we were heading in the right direction. I was disappointed at the lack of a commitment to mobilize greater  funding for the developing world, but what did reassure me was the increased consensus among both the political and business decision makers that we needed to do something immediately. Delegates from more than 100 countries agreeing that we needed one voice and approach to the climate was the starting point and momentum has been building ever since.
In the majority of board rooms there is also consensus. Now more than ever, business leaders want to do the right thing and want to demonstrate it. The big challenge has been how. The ISSB’s core mission has been to make the process of demonstrating it simpler. The current landscape is disparate – with different territories and different businesses often forced to use different methodology to demonstrate what they are doing to tackle the crisis, and how their business is and will be affected by our changing climate. The developing world risks being left behind if they do not report the metrics that tick the boxes for benchmarks that investors increasingly rely on.
This new global set of standards is designed to finally shift the dial away from confusion and regulatory disparities toward an agreed framework – making it far easier for businesses to genuinely challenge themselves and for investors to make informed decisions on who best reflects their ambitions to invest in sustainable organizations. The challenge now is to ensure that jurisdictions and regulators around the world enforce the standards or incorporate them into local requirements in a consistent and comparable way.
In KPMG’s latest Survey of Sustainability Reporting, published late last year, we revealed that there was a steady rise in the number of companies providing sustainability reports, but the data was patchy with evidence of a continuing disconnect between the urgency of climate change and the hard data provided by businesses. Our findings also revealed only 64 percent of G250 companies formally acknowledges that climate change was a risk to their business. The data highlights the gap between rhetoric and action.
The ISSB’s new standards will be a challenge for companies and jurisdictions to implement initially, but it’s essential that the world takes notice and acts. They are crucially designed to be globally applicable – considering the resources and experience of those in the global south as well as the most sophisticated companies, helping to level the playing field.
Of course the ISSB is not working alone. The EU has now adopted the first of its European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRSs) and in the US the Securities and Exchange Commission’s proposed climate rule is currently pending. But the ISSBTM Standards are different because they aim to provide a global baseline for sustainability reporting. For companies that work across multiple jurisdictions, the publication of these standards is a vital step.
If you’re a business leader reading this article, the question you’re probably asking is what you should be doing next? My answer is act now. For the ISSB Standards to make a real difference, we need to see true global adoption. The world remains in flux and in crisis. We’ve been handed some of the tools to play our part in reversing the damage. Let’s get to work.

"July 31, 2023",Sustainable Bond Volumes Outperforming Market in all Regions Except North America: Moody’s,"Issuance volumes of green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked (GSSS) bonds rebounded strongly in the first half of 2023, rising 7% year-over-year to $526 billion even as overall bond market issuance volumes fell 7% over the same period, with green bonds volumes hitting record levels, according to a new report from Moody’s Investors Service.
The report indicated a growing divergence in the sustainable finance market by region, with absolute issuance volume growth in most regions, but declines in North America. European issuers dominated GSSS bond issuance in the second quarter, representing half of global volumes and with GSSS bond volumes representing 20% share of bond issuance in the region. Market share rose as well to 12% in Asia Pacific, 29% in Middle East and Africa and 32% in Latin America and Caribbean. In North America, however, volumes fell to $25 billion in the quarter, the lowest since Q2 2020, with share declining to only 4% of the overall bond market in the region.
For the second quarter, GSSS bond issuance volumes of $258 billion were flat over the same period last year, recovering from a sharp decline in the second half of 2022, and significantly outperforming the broader market, with GSSS bonds rising to 15% share of global bond market issuance.
By bond type, green bonds continued to dominate, with issuance in the second quarter of $156 billion representing over 60% of volumes, and first half issuances of $312 billion exceeding the prior record of $295 billion set in H2 2021. Sovereigns led the green bond market in the quarter with issuance volumes of $49 billion, followed closely by nonfinancial companies at $48 billion, and financial institutions at $35 billion.
Social bonds rebounded 24% over the prior year to $51 billion in the quarter on the strength of a small number of large transactions from agency issuers, while sustainability bond issuances grew 2% year-over year to $40 billion, but declined on a quarterly basis after volumes in Q1 nearly doubled from the prior quarter.
Sustainability linked bonds continued their volatile performance, with Q2 volumes falling 50% quarter over quarter to $11 billion after a strong Q1 rebound. After rapid growth in 2021, SLB volumes were hit last year and continue to be pressured as issuers face scrutiny of the credibility and robustness of their linked sustainability targets, and due to the sector’s exposure to high-yield issuance.
Following the strong overall performance in the first half of 2023, Moody’s indicated that the GSSS bond market has the potential to eclipse its full year issuance forecast of $950 billion, which would represent 10% growth over the prior year. One of the key obstacles to the market’s growth noted by the report is a marked drop in first-time issuers, with debut issuances falling to an average of 29 per month in H1 2023 from 51 in 2022. While noting that a drop in first time issuers should be expected as the market matures, the report also highlighted heightened greenwashing scrutiny, an increasingly complex ESG regulatory and political landscape, and broader issuance conditions as factors that may be holding back new GSSS bond issuers.
Matt Kuchtyak, VP-Sustainable Finance at Moody’s Investors Service, said:
“We expect fairly robust GSSS bond volumes in the second half of the year, with the potential for issuance to eclipse our $950 billion forecast for all of 2023. However, growth in the second half of the year could be tempered by a drop in the number of first-time sustainable bond issuers, declining issuance in some markets such as the US, and the potential for higher borrowing costs and tighter lending to curtail global macroeconomic growth.”","REPORTS, STUDIES/ SUSTAINABLE FINANCE",ESGTODAY

"July 27, 2023","Guest Post: Climate Change, Extreme Weather Driving Insurance Urgency","By Anthony Lee, Principal, KPMG Insurance Sector practice
With an increase in significant natural disasters in the first half of 2023, climate change and extreme weather risk are at the forefront for property owners, insurance companies, and regulators.
Insurance broker BMS estimates that this year insurance losses to severe weather have surpassed $26 billion as of mid-July, which is the highest mid-year figure since 2011. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reports that based on preliminary data there have been 12 confirmed weather and climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each, including both insured and uninsured. This compares to an annual average of 8 such events from 1980 to 2022.   
Major insurance companies have stopped writing new home insurance policies in areas, in some cases entire states, they consider high risk, making it difficult for individuals to buy insurance amid various climate change disasters.
A recent federal report called on state regulators to increase their efforts to address the climate-risk challenging insurers. The report noted that insurers face risk due to their investment in real estate as well as the policies they issue. To help address the ramifications of climate risks in its state, the California Department of Insurance recently held a public workshop to discuss catastrophe modeling and insurance.

How can the insurance industry and its stakeholders navigate the challenges posed by climate change and extreme weather? Collaboration among stakeholders is key. Three critical areas are achieving consensus on adequate insurance rates, developing risk mitigation and collaboration by federal and local governments to strengthen infrastructure.

In a new collaboration, NOAA and the National Science Foundation announced earlier this year that they would jointly create an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center focused on catastrophe modeling and climate change risk assessment to support the needs of the insurance sector.
Insurance rates
California exemplifies the ramification of climate change and extreme weather, such as significant wildfires, on property insurance rates and availability. Insurers would like to use predictions of future wildfire risk as the basis for their rate proposals instead of the requirement that they use historical claims data only. During the state’s recent public workshop on catastrophe modeling and insurance, the nonprofit Consumer Watchdog proposed that California develop a public model to predict wildfires.
Risk mitigation
The insurance industry should continue to increase focus on prevention services for homeowners. For example, the Internet of Things as part of a data and analytics tool, is one way to utilize technology as a prevention method for customers to make homes safer due to the ability to predict and prevent damage from potential natural disasters. We have seen organizations set up early warnings systems using drones, sensors and data and analytics.
The Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS) has shared a few practices for homeowners to establish resilient housing. Tips include regularly cleaning the roof and gutters, using non-combustible fences and gates, fireproofing the deck, and more. By implementing this advice, homeowners stand a better chance of making their houses more resilient to wildfires which could potentially lead to lower insurance rates.
Resilient infrastructure
The impact of extreme weather has increased the urgency for investment in resilient infrastructure. But there are a few challenges. First, a large population of Americans live in flood zones or in rural wilderness areas because they cannot afford to live in other places that are further from potential climate danger areas. Beyond the affordability factor, some Americans have chosen to live closer to or in wilderness areas, or near water, as a lifestyle choice.
Second, there is a lack of quality infrastructure planning and preparedness. According to the 2021 report card from the American Society of Civil Engineers, U.S. infrastructure scored a D.  For example, the average age of the nation’s dams is 57 years. By 2030, 70% of the dams in the US will be over 50 years old. While not a reflection on hazard potential, this means that most of dams will not have been built to current or newer standards that improve resilience and reduce risk.
Now there are actions in cities across the country to develop sturdier infrastructure to combat the effects of extreme weather events. For example, residents in New Orleans, Louisiana, developed a plan to build ditches, rain barrels, and dry creeks designed to hold large amounts of water and reduce runoff that could destroy homes. Additionally, the Biden Administration has provided $197 million from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law to help communities prepare for wildfires.
Insurance companies can encourage change through sustainability bonds that can support cities and municipalities to act by financing green and other social projects as an incentive. In California, the Forest Resilience Bond, developed by nonprofit investment firm Blue Forest Conservation, is providing cost-effective climate solutions to help communities dealing with the impact of wildfires by shifting the costs of forest restoration from the state’s forest service to private investors.
Investing in sustainability projects can offer insurance companies a competitive advantage in the marketplace while simultaneously contributing to society by supporting climate change mitigation.
Looking ahead
The impact of extreme weather events has caused the insurance market to adjust and rethink its strategy and approach to serving customers. Prevention services should be top of mind for insurance companies to help their customers reduce exposure to disaster. For instance, various insurance companies are providing their policyholders with protection offerings by collaborating with organizations that specialize in risk intervention services. In one example, homeowners in the Western U.S. can have their property inspected for wildfire susceptibility, obtain active monitoring of potential wildfires, and engage risk prevention professionals to implement pre-suppression measures including sprinkler set up and fuel-break preparation, if notified of a fire.
The potential risk calls for a sense of urgency among stakeholders to create more joint strategies to strengthen the industry’s approach to climate solutions to combat the impacts on property owners and the insurance business. ",ENVIRONMENT/ GUEST POSTS/ SUSTAINABLE FINANCE,ESGTODAY
"July 27, 2023",Home Depot Commits to Reduce Emissions from Sold Products by 25% by 2030,"Home Depot announced today a series of new climate-related goals, including a target to reduce emissions from the use of the products that it sells by 25% by 2030, along with other 2030 commitments to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 42%, compared with 2020.
Scope 3 emissions, or those originating across the value chain outside of a company’s direct control, account for more than 70% of Home Depot’s emissions footprint, with “Use of Sold Products” representing the most significant Scope 3 category for the company.
The new goals were announced alongside the release of Home Depot’s 2023 ESG Report, which also included details on the company’s plans to address product emissions, including working with suppliers to improve the energy efficiency of their products, and prioritizing sales of high-efficiency electrified products. The company also outlined two targets to help drive these improvements, including a goal, announced last month, to have more than 85% of its US and Canada sales of outdoor power equipment, including lawn mowers, to be powered by rechargeable batteries by 2028, and a goal to help customers save $600 million in energy costs by 2026 through proper use of energy-saving products.
Home Depot said that it developed its new goals in accordance with the standards of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and that it has submitted them for SBTi approval.
Ted Decker, Chair, President & CEO, said:
“Submitting our targets to SBTi, a globally recognized organization, provides accountability and helps demonstrate our commitment to reducing our emissions in line with the latest climate science.”
Additional new sustainability goals included in Home Depot’s ESG Report include targets to help customers reduce water use by 100 billion gallons by 2026, have all private brand fiber packaging for new SKUs will be compostable, recyclable, or recycled content by 2028, motivate top-tier strategic suppliers to have a business-relevant publicly stated sustainability goal by 2025, invest 10 million hours of training to frontline associates and 2.5 million hours of leadership training to leaders supporting their career growth and skill development by 2028, and create 75,000 career advancement opportunities for front-line associates over a five-year period.

"July 27, 2023","Walmart, PepsiCo to Invest $120 Million in Regenerative Agriculture","Walmart and PepsiCo announced the launch of a new strategic collaboration aimed at enabling the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices on more than 2 million acres of farmland in the U.S. and Canada.
The company’s plan to invest $120 million focused on supporting farmers to improve soil health and water quality.
Regenerative agriculture practices are aimed at addressing the environmental impact of the sector, and include techniques to improve and restore ecosystems, build soil health and fertility, reduce emissions, enhance watershed management, increase biodiversity, and improve farmers’ livelihoods.
Agriculture has emerged as a major focus area for climate action, as the sector accounts for a significant proportion of GHG emissions, and is among the most difficult areas to address climate impact. The sector contributes a significant proportion of the climate impact of the food and beverage sector, which in turn accounts for approximately a third of global GHG emissions.
According to the companies, the new initiative aims to deliver approximately 4 million metric tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and removals by 2030.
Jane Ewing, Senior Vice President for sustainability at Walmart, said:
“At Walmart, our sustainability strategy is built to make the everyday choice the sustainable choice for our customers. This collaboration with PepsiCo is a great example of how we are prioritizing the expansion of regenerative agricultural practices among farmers across North America so that we can continue to make quality products affordable and accessible for customers.”
The new initiative follows the launch by PepsiCo in 2021 of its wide-ranging sustainability agenda, pep+, which includes “Positive Agriculture” as one of its three key pillars, with a goal to spread regenerative practices to restore the Earth across the company’s 7 million acre agricultural footprint. Walmart’s sustainability goals include targets to help protect, manage or restore at least 50 million acres of land and one million square miles of ocean by 2030.
Under the new collaboration, the companies said that they aim to elevate farmer livelihoods and engage with them on how to more sustainably managing soil health and increase yields. The companies also said the collaboration could create a model other product categories could use for other brands to also invest in regenerative agriculture.
Steven Williams, Chief Executive Officer, PepsiCo Foods North America, said:
“This effort is a new model for PepsiCo, marking our first, large-scale strategic collaboration focused on sustainable agriculture with a retail partner. Farmers are critical to our business, and many of the brands our consumers know and love rely on ingredients that we source straight from the farm. By joining forces with Walmart, we’ll be empowering farmers through education, upfront investment in outcomes, peer coaching and cost-sharing – and hopefully inspiring others to join us.”",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT,ESGTODAY
"July 27, 2023","Global Automakers to Build EV Charging Network Across U.S., Canada","Seven of the world’s largest automakers announced that they will create a joint venture aimed at deploying a high-powered electric vehicle charging network across North America, with a target to install at least 30,000 chargers across neighborhoods and highways, intended to be powered solely by renewable energy.
The coalition includes BMW, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, and Stellantis.
The venture would add significant capacity to the North American EV charging network, with the U.S. Department of Energy estimating that there are currently 32,000 publicly available DC fast chargers in the U.S., and comes as the EV market is poised to grow significantly over the next few years, following an executive order by President Biden mandating that zero emissions vehicles make up half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. by 2030.
The group said that the JV “aims to become the leading network of reliable high-powered charging stations in North America.”
BMW Group CEO Oliver Zipse said:
“North America is one of the world’s most important car markets – with the potential to be a leader in electromobility. Accessibility to high-speed charging is one of the key enablers to accelerate this transition. Therefore, seven automakers are forming this joint venture with the goal of creating a positive charging experience for EV consumers.”
The JV’s initial plans call for the deployment of charging stations in metropolitan areas and along major highways, including connecting corridors and vacation routes. Each station will offer both Combined Charging System (CCS) used by multiple automakers and Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS). The automakers added that the stations will allow for seamless integration with each others’ in-vehicle and in-app experiences, including reservations, intelligent route planning and navigation, and payment applications.
The partners also stated that the leverage public and private funds to accelerate the installation of EV chargers, noting in particular the generational investments in public charging being implemented on the Federal and State level. The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocates $7.5 billion for the development of a network of electric vehicle chargers, including $5 billion over five years for the development of an EV charging network across the interstate highway system announced last year under the BIL’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI). The automakers said that the new stations will meet or exceed the requirements of the NEVI program.
The JV’s first stations are expected to be opened in the U.S. in 2024, and in Canada at a later date.

"July 26, 2023",Republicans Propose New Series of Anti-ESG Reporting and Investing Laws,"Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee in the U.S. Congress announced on Tuesday the introduction of a series of bills aimed at pushing back on the influence of ESG initiatives in capital and financial markets including proposals to derail efforts to implement ESG and climate-related disclosure requirements on companies, and to reduce the ability of investors to engage with companies on sustainability issues.
Proposals in the new bills include only requiring companies to report only on issues that they have determined as material, allowing companies to exclude ESG-related shareholder proposals from proxy materials, and reducing the ability of regulators to collaborate on climate-related financial risk.
The move marks the latest in a string of anti-ESG initiatives by Republican politicians in the U.S., with the committee describing the new bills as aimed at addressing “the threats environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives pose to the American financial system.” House Republicans launched an “ESG Working Group” in February 2023, to coordinate the party’s approach on ESG proposals, with focus areas including the SEC’s upcoming climate-related disclosure rules, and the use of the proxy voting process by investors “to impose ideological preferences in ways that circumvent democratic lawmaking.”
In a statement announcing the new proposals, the committee said:
“These measures represent the first step in Republican efforts to combat the ESG movement by restricting politically motivated, non-material disclosure mandates, reforming the proxy voting and shareholder proposal processes, increasing transparency for federal banking regulators, and limiting the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) authority to regulate shareholder proposals.”
The new bills include the Guiding Uniform and Responsible Disclosure Requirements and Information Limits (GUARDRAIL) Act, which targets the SEC’s upcoming climate-related disclosure rules. The proposal would only allow the SEC to require disclosure that the issuer has determined as material to a voting or investment decision. The bill also requires the SEC to evaluate the “detrimental impact” and the legal basis for recent European rules that effectively require large U.S. companies to provide sustainability-related disclosures, including the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence (CSDD) legislation.
Congressman Bill Huizenga, sponsor of the GUARDRAIL Act, said:
“Since taking over at the SEC, Chair Gensler has seemingly done everything in this power to dismantle our capital markets. Americans saving for retirement need less immaterial disclosure regulations that ultimately drive-up costs and reduce returns for everyday investors. The GUARDRAIL Act takes positive and deliberate steps to refocus the SEC on its core mission instead of pushing a political and social agenda.”
The Protecting Americans’ Retirement Savings from Politics Act includes proposals that would make it more difficult for investors to address ESG issues through the shareholder proposal and proxy voting process, including a rule allowing issuers to exclude shareholder proposals from its materials for shareholder meetings “if the subject matter is environmental, social, or political.” The bill also introduces rules for proxy advisory firms, which have been targeted by Republican politicians over their support for climate and DEI-related issues, and requires asset managers to have written consent from investors to consider “non-pecuniary” factors in their decision making.
Other bills introduced by the committee include the American Financial Institution Regulator Sovereignty and Transparency (American FIRST) Act, which includes rules not allowing U.S. regulators to meet with organizations including the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision on the topic of climate-related risk unless a series of requirements are met, and the Businesses Over Activists Act, targeting the SEC’s control over shareholder proposals.
Businesses Over Activists Act sponsor Congressman Ralph Norman said:
“ESG is an evil pollutant that must be eradicated from corporations and businesses. Ultimately, the Businesses Over Activists Act would preserve the first amendment rights of corporations and impede economic damages stemming from the misuse of resources delegated to the management of these politized proposals. The SEC should not and does not have the authority to compel companies to include ESG proposals.”",ESG REPORTING/ GOVERNMENT/ INVESTORS/ REGULATORS,ESGTODAY

According to the ASIC allegations, however, ESG research was not conducted over a significant proportion of the bond issuers in the fund, exposing investors to investments with ties to fossil fuels, including issuers such as Chevron Phillips Chemical and Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline, among others.
In a statement announcing the launch of the court action, ASIC said that it “alleges Vanguard misled the public in Product Disclosure Statements published between 7 August 2018 to 17 February 2021, a media release issued in August 2018, in statements on its website, statements made in an interview with Finance News Network and statements made in a presentation at a Finance News Network Fund Manager Event both of which were recorded and published online.”
ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said:
“We consider that the screening and research undertaken on behalf of Vanguard was far more limited than that being promised to investors, and we consider this constitutes another example of greenwashing.”
In a statement on its website following the launch of the court action by ASIC, Vanguard said that it self-identified and self-reported to ASIC in early 2021, after discovering that the descriptions of the exclusionary screens made by the index provider and in Vanguard’s disclosure statements “did not provide a sufficiently detailed explanation that certain debt issuers lacking research coverage were still included in the benchmark,” making it possible for the fund to hold securities “that may not have been reasonably expected by investors.” Vanguard added that it informed investors and enhanced the disclosure of the fund.
The investment manager highlighted actions it has taken to strengthen its product disclosure process since then, including appointing a Head of ESG product, adding compliance and product resourcing in its product disclosure and oversight teams, enhancing its due diligence process and investing in improved technology.
Vanguard said:
“Vanguard is committed to serving our clients ESG investing needs and will continue to enhance our ESG product management, oversight and disclosure, in addition to actively working with the industry, policy makers and regulators in pursuit of continuous improvement in this space.”
The proceedings against Vanguard follows a statement last year by ASIC Chair Joseph Longo, warning providers of investment funds and financial products that the regulator was watching out for misleading sustainability claims, and that it was providing guidance for fund managers and issuers to keep clear of greenwashing. ASIC launched its first greenwashing suit earlier this year against Marsh McLennan company Mercer Superannuation, and the regulator has issued a series of infringement notices to several investment managers, including three against Vanguard.
Court said:
“ASIC will continue its focus on alleged greenwashing conduct and we continue to stress to the financial services industry that if exclusions in investments are promised, these exclusions need to be applied and promises upheld.”",INVESTORS/ REGULATORS,ESGTODAY
"July 25, 2023",Meyer Burger to Build 2 GW Solar Cell Plant in U.S.,"Swiss solar technology manufacturer Meyer Burger announced plans to build a new solar cell production facility in Colorado Springs, CO.
The plant will have an initial capacity of 2 GW, and will manufacture and exclusively supply “Made in USA” solar cells to the company’s solar module production facility in Goodyear, AZ.
The project, targeted to begin in Q1 of 2024, will be supported by a tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act, the law signed by President Biden in 2022 which includes the U.S.’ largest ever set of climate-focused investments. The Act allocates nearly $370 billion to areas including renewable energy and industrial decarbonization solutions, including over $60 billion to accelerate domestic manufacturing of clean energy and transportation technologies through production and investment tax credits, loans, and grants.
The company added that the expansion of its strategy to “Made in USA” solar cells was made in response to new regulations in the U.S., based on guidelines announced by the U.S. Treasury Department for the qualification of domestic content, which allows an additional 10% bonus investment tax credit for U.S. solar projects.
Overall, the company estimated that it is potentially eligible for $1.4 billion of tax credits from 2024 through 2032.
Gunter Erfurt, CEO of Meyer Burger, said:
“Meyer Burger strongly believes that domestically manufactured solar cells will bring additional value to our customers, both in relation to using best-in-class high performance solar products ‘Made in USA’ and in terms of qualifying for additional tax credits.”
According to the company, the new plant will be developed from former semiconductor fabrication facility in order to enable the fastest possible market entry.
In order to meet the planned completion date, Meyer Burger will repurpose production equipment initially intended for the previously announced 2 GW solar cell expansion at its Thalheim site in Germany. As part of Meyer Burger’s successful application for the EU Innovation Fund, there are plans for a later expansion in Thalheim at a later stage.
Erfurt said:
“Meyer Burger is a driving force for the expansion of solar energy in the U.S. as well as in Germany and Europe. We would be pleased to lay the foundation for a transatlantic solar energy partnership and also expand our manufacturing in Germany and the European Union in the future.”
Erfurt added that the company is currently working on multiple offtake agreements with new customers in the U.S., and is exploring opportunities to add further solar cell and module production in the U.S. as well.",COMPANIES/ ENERGY TRANSITION,ESGTODAY
"July 25, 2023","EU Council Adopts Laws Aimed at Cutting Emissions from Transport, Vehicles, Energy Consumption","The European Council announced today the adoption of a series of laws and regulations aimed at achieving the EU’s climate goals, including rules to reduce energy consumption through 2030 across the EU, and legislation mandating the deployment of more recharging and refueling stations for alternative fuels across Europe, as well as reductions in emissions in the maritime transport sector, and.
The announcements mark the final major steps in several elements of the European Commission’s “Fit for 55” roadmap – the EU’s proposed strategy to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. Each of the new laws will be entered into the EU’s official journal, and subsequently come into force.
The energy efficiency directive aims to reduce final energy consumption at EU level by 11.7% in 2030, compared with 2030 forecasts made in 2020. Under the directive, member states will collectively ensure the achievement of the 2030 goal, with binding limits for final consumption, or the energy consumed by end users, while each will set an indicative target for primary energy consumption, which includes what is used for the production and supply of energy. The rules also include requirements for the public sector, excluding public transport and the armed forces, to achieve an annual energy consumption reduction of 1.9%.
The alternative fuel infrastructure regulation (AFIR), aimed at enabling the transition to zero emission transport, and addressing consumer refueling concerns that could impede the switch to zero emission vehicles, mandates a significant increase in electric vehicle recharging and hydrogen refueling stations across Europe’s main transport networks. The law sets requirements for publicly available charging infrastructure for cars and vans, and for the deployment of fast-charging stations every 60 km along the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) by 2025, as well as for recharging stations dedicated to heavy-duty vehicles every 60 km along the TEN-T core network, and every 100 km on the larger TEN-T comprehensive network from 2025 onwards, with complete network coverage to be achieved by 2030.
The new AFIR law also requires the deployment of hydrogen refueling infrastructure to serve cars and trucks every 200 km along the TEN-T core network by 2030.
Raquel Sánchez Jiménez, Spanish Minister of Transport, Mobility and Urban Agenda, said:
“The new law is a milestone of our ‘Fit for 55’ policy providing for more public recharging capacity on the streets in cities and along the motorways across Europe. We are optimistic that in the near future, citizens will be able to charge their electric cars as easily as they do today in traditional petrol stations.”
The maritime transport-focused law, Fuel EU Maritime, aims to increase demand for and use of renewable and low carbon fuels for waterborne transport, and drive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for the sector, while balancing the need to ensure smooth operation of maritime traffic. The regulation includes requirements to gradually reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of fuels used by the shipping sector, starting with a 2% reduction in 2025, and reaching as much as 80% by 2050, and also introduces a requirement for zero-emission at berth, mandating the use of on-shore power supply or other zero-emission technologies in ports by passenger ships and containerships.
Sánchez Jiménez added:
“The new law will provide legal certainty for ship operators and fuel producers and help kick-start the large-scale production of sustainable maritime fuels, thus substantially delivering on our climate targets at European and global level.”",ENERGY TRANSITION/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY

"July 25, 2023",United Raises $200 Million for Sustainable Aviation Venture Fund,"United Airlines announced today that it has grown its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)-focused investment fund, the United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight Fund, to nearly $200 million, and added eight new corporate partners to the fund.
Launched earlier this year with commitments of over $100 million of investments from United, and inaugural partners including Air Canada, Boeing, GE Aerospace, JPMorgan Chase, and Honeywell, the fund invests in and supports startups focused on SAF research, technology and production.
New partners joining the fund include American Express Global Business Travel (Amex GBT), Aramco Ventures, Aviation Capital Group, Bank of America, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Groupe ADP, Hawaiian Airlines and JetBlue Ventures.
Amex GBT CEO Paul Abbott said:
“By investing in the United Ventures fund, we are helping to bring the industry together to drive the innovation and investment required to create a more sustainable future for travel.”
Sustainable aviation fuel is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry, which currently accounts for 2-3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. SAF is generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.
The fund prioritizes investments in new technology, advanced fuel sources and proven producers, aimed at supporting the scaling of SAF supply. Investments to date include algae-to-biofuel company Viridos, and carbon capture and removal technology provider Svante.
United Airlines has committed to fully reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 without relying on carbon offsets, and the airline leads the industry with investments in future production of more than 5 billion gallons of SAF.
United Airlines Ventures President Michael Leskinen said:
“As companies across the globe are increasingly looking for ways to reduce their environmental impact from flying, the UAV Sustainable Flight Fund presents a unique opportunity – instead of fighting over the current limited supply of SAF, with our partners, we’re working collaboratively to help scale the SAF industry itself, and to get an equity stake in groundbreaking technology while doing it.”",COMPANIES/ ENERGY TRANSITION/ PRIVATE EQUITY,ESGTODAY
"July 25, 2023",IOSCO Calls on Regulators to Incorporate New IFRS Sustainability Reporting Standards,"IOSCO, the leading international policy forum and standards setter for securities regulators, announced today its official endorsement of the new IFRS sustainability and climate-related disclosure standards, in a move it called a “major step towards consistent, comparable and reliable sustainability information.”
With the endorsement, IOSCO said that it is now calling on its 130 member jurisdictions, which together regulate more than 95% of global financial markets, to consider the incorporation of the new standards into their regulatory frameworks.
Jean-Paul Servais, Chair of the Board of IOSCO, said:
“At the beginning of my mandate as Chairman, I said IOSCO would meet expectations because the delivery of high quality standards in due time is of the essence when it comes to sustainability. Today, with the publication of the endorsement decision, I am honoured to say we did just that.”
The endorsement follows the publication last month by the IFRS Foundation’s International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) of its new global standards for sustainability and climate reporting, IFRS S1 and IFRS S2.
IOSCO had signaled its support for the ISSB project early on, and in early 2021 launched a Technical Expert Group (TEG) to work closely with the ISSB and to assess its technical recommendations, including whether the it could be a sound basis for the development of an international reporting standard.
In its statement announcing its endorsement, IOSCO said that it has determined that the standards “are appropriate to serve as a global framework for capital markets to develop the use of sustainability-related financial information.”
Calling today’s announcement “an important milestone, Rodrigo Buenaventura, Chair of IOSCO’s Sustainable Finance Task Force, said that the endorsement “will result in global capital markets being able to access reliable, consistent and comparable sustainability related information which will allow investors to price sustainability risks and opportunities and help them make investment decisions.”
Alongside IOSCO’s endorsement, the IFRS Foundation announced the publication of an outline of its upcoming Adoption Guide for regulators, planned for release later this year, outlining the mechanisms it is developing to support regulatory implementation of the new standards.
ISSB Chair Emmanuel Faber said:
“Widespread regulatory adoption of a global baseline of sustainability-related disclosures through the ISSB Standards will secure the consistency and comparability of information that capital markets demand. IOSCO’s timely endorsement and strong encouragement for capital market authorities to act confirms that the ISSB Standards are fit for purpose.”",ESG REPORTING/ REGULATORS,ESGTODAY
"July 25, 2023",Canada to Phase Out Public Fossil Fuel Financing,"The Government of Canada announced on Monday a series of initiatives aimed at reducing government support for the fossil fuel sector, including the release of a new framework and guidelines, effective immediately, to eliminate “inefficient” fossil fuel subsidies.
According to a government statement announcing the launch of the new framework, the initiative forms part of Canada’s commitment under the Glasgow Statement, a 34-nation agreement signed at the 2021 COP 26 summit, to shift public finance away from fossil fuels and in support of the energy transition.
The new “Fossil Fuel Subsidies Government of Canada Self‑Review Assessment Framework,” – the first of its kind globally, according to the government – details a set of criteria to determine that subsidies to the energy sector must meet in order to not be considered inefficient. Criteria include enabling significant greenhouse gas emissions reductions, supporting clean energy, clean technology, or renewable energy, providing essential energy service to a remote community or short-term support for emergency response, supporting Indigenous economic participation in fossil fuel activities and supporting abated production processes such as carbon capture, utilization, and storage or projects with a credible plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2030.
The guidelines released alongside the framework provide a standardized methodology to ensure that future government support is aligned with the country’s climate and energy priorities, and precludes funding of discretionary programs not aligned with the framework.
Canada’s Environment and Climate Change Minister Steven Guilbeault said:
“By eliminating inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, we are encouraging smart and efficient government investment decisions that can increase Canada’s competitiveness in a decarbonizing global economy, while avoiding creation of stranded assets. Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies in Canada will ensure government programs and spending support an energy sector that is aligned with our ambitious climate goals.”
The government also announced that it will work to identify current public financing by 2024, and develop an implementation plan by fall 2024 to phase out public financing of the fossil fuel sector, beyond the scope of the new subsidy elimination commitment.
Environmental groups welcomed the Canada’s announcement, while urging the government to go farther in its commitment, noting that subsidies only account for a small portion of public financing to the energy sector, and that the announcement leaves the door open to some fossil fuel financing.
Laura Cameron, Policy Advisor at think tank the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) said:
“This is a significant step forward and sets a strong example for Canada’s G20 peers. But gaps in the framework mean public money could continue to flow toward oil and gas production at a time when the country must swiftly move to renewable energy. With these gaps closed, Canada can ensure public funds are advancing climate solutions.”",ENERGY TRANSITION/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY

"July 24, 2023",SAP Asks Top Suppliers to Report Product-Level Emissions by 2027,"Leading enterprise application software company SAP said today that it plans to establish a multi-phased supply chain engagement program by 2024, aimed at significantly reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across its upstream value chain, including a goal to have each of its top 100 suppliers reporting their company-wide and product-level emissions for key products by 2027.
In a post announcing the new plans, SAP Chief Procurement Officer Nikolaus Kirner said:
“As a purpose-driven company, we are always looking for ways to improve through our global procurement organization. Sustainable procurement practices have become one of the key enablers in achieving net-zero targets.”
The announcement follows the launch last year by SAP of a commitment to achieve net zero emissions across its value chain in 2030, with a pledge to strength its engagement with key suppliers to commit to net zero and to deliver products and services on a carbon-neutral basis identified as a key focus area to reach its goal.

"July 24, 2023",UK Court Rejects Attempt to Revive Climate Lawsuit Against Shell Directors,"The UK High Court has rejected an attempt by environmental law organization ClientEarth to overturn the dismissal of its climate-focused legal action against the board of directors of energy giant Shell, with the ruling by Mr Justice Trower stating that ClientEarth has not “has made out a prima facie case that the Directors are in breach of their duties.”
ClientEarth said that it was disappointed by the ruling, and that it plans to appeal the dismissal.
ClientEarth launched its lawsuit in February, arguing that Shell’s energy transition strategy was flawed, putting shareholder value at risk, and asked the court to order the board to strengthen the company’s climate plans. The suit was the first of its kind seeking to hold corporate directors personally accountable to prepare for the energy transition.
The legal action claimed that the Directors’ duties to promote the success of the company and to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence included several climate-related duties, including adopting strategies likely to meet the company’s targets to mitigate climate risk.
The suit was dismissed in May, however, with Trower’s decision agreeing with an argument by Shell that the apparent incidental duties were vague, and against principles that require directors to determine the weight to attach to the factors they consider.
In an oral hearing earlier this month, ClientEarth asked the judge to reconsider the dismissal of the claim, but the request was denied in today’s decision.
In his decision, the judge stated that ClientEarth’s arguments make clear that the organization “seek(s) to impose specific obligations on the Directors as to how the management of Shell’s business and affairs should be conducted.”
The judge also pointed out in the May ruling that ClientEarth’s very small stake in Shell, holding only 27 shares, “gives rise to a very clear inference that its real interest is not in how best to promote the success of Shell for the benefit of its members as a whole,” and that while ClientEarth’s contention that the board’s acceptance of climate risk as a serious risk to the business creates specific duties for the board, “I still think that their formulation is inconsistent with the well-established principle that it is for directors themselves to determine (acting in good faith) how best to promote the success of a company for the benefit of its members as a whole.”
In a statement released following the decision, a Shell spokesperson said:
“This is the right outcome – the court has reaffirmed its decision that this claim is fundamentally flawed and has, once again, dismissed it.
“We believe our Directors have always complied with their duties and acted in the company’s best interest. This claim entirely ignores how directors of a business as large and complex as Shell must balance a range of competing considerations.”
The judge’s decision also pointed out that ClientEarth holds only 27 shares in Shell, giving substance to the company’s argument that “ClientEarth’s motivation is driven by something quite different from a balanced consideration as to how best to enforce the multifarious factors which the Directors are bound to take into account when assessing what is in the best interests of Shell.”
In statement following the ruling, ClientEarth senior lawyer Paul Benson said:
“We are disappointed that the Judge has declined to reconsider his decision. The hearing was the first step towards appeal, which we will now pursue.
“The Court has accepted that climate change poses significant and foreseeable risks to Shell. We firmly stand behind our claim that the Board is currently neglecting to address those risks adequately, to the detriment of its shareholders.”
Benson added:
“The Board’s refusal to take decisive action to prepare the company for the fast-advancing energy transition puts Shell’s future commercial viability at risk and, we maintain, is in breach of the Board’s duties under English law.”",COMPANIES/ ENERGY TRANSITION,ESGTODAY
"July 24, 2023",Climate Tech Startup Aeroseal Raises $67 Million to Tackle Building Emissions,"Climate tech company Aeroseal announced that it has raised $67 million, with funding aimed at advancing the company’s efforts solutions aimed at reducing carbon emissions from buildings.
Buildings are a key source of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and also one of the hardest to replace, given their long-term nature. Heating, cooling and ventilation (HVAC) accounts for around half of building emissions. According to the World Green Building Council almost 50% of the energy needed to heat or cool buildings is wasted through air duct leaks.
Founded in 2010, Ohio-based Aeroseal provides a technology that introduces a fog of non-toxic polymers into a building’s pressurized air ducts and envelopes, creating a gum that seals the ducts without requiring physical access to the locations, significantly reducing energy waste due to leaks in HVAC systems.
According to Aeroseal, its solution is 50% more effective at sealing duct leaks than traditional methods and can reduce labor time and costs for duct sealing by as much as 70%. The company said that it has already sealed over 260,000 homes and thousands of commercial buildings across 30 countries, resulting in a reduction of more than half a million tons of CO2 emissions.
Amit Gupta, CEO of Aeroseal, said:
“The industry is taking notice of this ‘easy button,’ with several top U.S. builders already adopting Aeroseal’s duct and envelope sealing technologies. We expect momentum to continue with increased demand for healthier energy-efficient spaces, tighter regulations, and greater statewide incentives for adopting newer codes.”
The Series B funding round was co-led by Bill Gates-founded investment firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures and decarbonization specialist investor Climate Investment, with new investors Beazer Homes and Aramco Ventures joining existing partners Building Ventures, 2150, and Energy Impact Partners.

SEBI also announced that introduced a new ESG investment sub-category for funds, in order to enable mutual funds to offer several ESG schemes to investors. Under the prior rules, mutual funds were able to offer only one ESG scheme under the thematic category.
According to SEBI, the new measures are being introduced in order to “facilitate green financing with thrust on enhanced disclosures and mitigation of green washing risk.”
Under the new rules, asset managers will now be able to offer multiple ESG funds under a series of defined strategies, including Exclusion, Integration, Best-in-class & Positive Screening, Impact investing, Sustainable objectives, and Transition or transition related investments. Funds will be required to have at least 80% of AUM invested in securities aligned with the strategy, with remaining assets not invested in securities in contrast to the strategy. Additionally, at least 65% of AUM will be required to be invested in companies which are reporting on comprehensive Business Responsibility   and Sustainability Report (BRSR) guidelines (introduced in 2021) and that provide assurance on BRSR disclosures.
New disclosure requirements for ESG schemes include a requirement for the name of the fund to clearly include the ESG strategy, and for BRSR scores to be included in monthly portfolio statements, along with the name of the ESG ratings provider.
Asset managers for ESG schemes will also be required to disclose on their voting on resolutions with rationale supporting their voting decision, including whether the vote was made for ESG reasons.
In their annual commentary, fund managers will be required to provide examples of how the ESG strategy was applied, how engagements were carried out and on the application of escalation strategies, as well as engagement case studies, and details on engagements including the number of engagements, modes of communication used and outcomes.
The new rules also require asset managers to obtain independent assurance that their ESG schemes are in compliance with their strategies and objectives, and that the board of the asset management company certify the compliance of the schemes with regulatory requirements.",ESG REPORTING/ INVESTORS/ REGULATORS,ESGTODAY

"July 20, 2023",Energy Dome Raises $60 Million for Global Rollout of Energy Storage Solution,"Energy storage startup Energy Dome announced today that it has raised €55 million ($60 million) in the second tranche of its Series B funding round, with proceeds aimed at scaling the global commercialization of its utility-scale storage solution, the CO2 Battery.
Founded in 2019, Milan, Italy-based Energy Dome enables expanded use of renewable energy by making solar and wind power dispatchable using its CO2 Battery, utilizing thermodynamic processes to use CO2 as an energy storage fluid at ambient temperature, and providing energy when the CO2 warms up, expands and turns a turbine to generate electricity, for dispatch into the grid as needed.
The first tranche of the funding round took place earlier in the year, and also follows an $11 million convertible funding round completed in June 2022.
According to Energy Dome, the new financing round will support its full commercial scaling worldwide, accelerating the company’s growth as it undertakes a project pipeline of over nine GWh for utilities, independent power producers, and corporations over five continents.
New investors joining the funding round included Innovation Development Oman Investments, Vopak Ventures, and investors represented by impact investing advisory firm Sagana. Existing investors participating in the tranche included CDP Venture Capital, with the investment kicking off the operations of its new Green Transition Fund, and 360 Capital.
Claudio Spadacini, Founder and CEO of Energy Dome, said:
“I am delighted to extend a warm welcome to our new investors joining Energy Dome on our mission to decarbonize the grid. Our technology can play a key role in enabling humanity to address the urgency of climate change without waiting until 2030.”",ENERGY TRANSITION/ PRIVATE EQUITY,ESGTODAY
"July 20, 2023",Virgin Atlantic Plans First-Ever 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel-Powered Transatlantic Flight this Year,"A consortium led by Virgin Atlantic announced today that it has scheduled the first-ever transatlantic flight using 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for November 28, 2023, following the successful completion of a key ground test, and pending further regulatory approvals and testing.
The upcoming flight, which still requires further regulatory approvals and testing, will be conducted on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which will fly from London Heathrow to New York JFK.
The consortium includes Rolls Royce, Boeing, University of Sheffield, Imperial College London and Rocky Mountain Institute, and the initiative is funded by the UK Government’s Department for Transport.
The announcement follows a pledge last year by the UK government to deliver the first-ever net-zero emissions transatlantic flight, powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel by the end of 2023, and an announcement in December by the government that Virgin Atlantic had won a competition to receive funding to operate the flight.
Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.
Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, however, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels. SAF currently represents less than 0.1% of jet fuel volumes, and fuel standards currently allow for only a 50% SAF blend in commercial jet engines.
The company said that the flight will demonstrate the potential of SAF as a 100% drop-in replacement for fossil-based jet fuels.
Shai Weiss, CEO, Virgin Atlantic, said:
“The 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel transatlantic flight will be a historic moment in aviation’s roadmap to decarbonisation. Alongside fleet transformation, SAF is the most readily available way for our industry to decarbonise, but currently there’s not enough supply and without it and the radical collaboration required to produce it, we can’t meet our 2030 targets.”
SAF for the flight will be supplied by fuel suppliers Air bp and Virent, and will include a blend of 88% Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), which utilizes waste fats, oils, and greases as feedstock, and 12% synthetic aromatic kerosene (SAK), derived from plant sugars.
Alongside the scheduling of the flight, Virgin Atlantic and Rolls-Royce confirmed the successful completion of a successful ground test on Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engine using 100% SAF, marking a key milestone in the approvals process.
Rob Watson, President of Civil Aerospace at Rolls-Royce, said:
“We are incredibly proud that our Trent 1000 engines will power the first ever flight using 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel across the Atlantic. Confirming that we have successfully completed the ground test of the Trent 1000 engine today, using the chosen 100% SAF blend, gives us increased confidence for the engine’s performance and operation ahead of the flight this November. The flight will represent an incredible milestone for the entire aviation industry in its journey towards net zero carbon emissions.”",COMPANIES/ ENERGY TRANSITION/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY
"July 20, 2023",82% of Business Leaders Confident in Meeting New Sustainability Disclosure Requirements: Honeywell Survey,"Over 80% of business leaders globally report being confident that their companies’ reporting processes will meet emerging disclosure requirements, according to a new survey released by industrial products, solutions and technologies company Honeywell.
The results were unveiled with the latest release of Honeywell’s Environmental Sustainable Index. Honeywell launched the index in Q4 2022, with updated releases planned quarterly, aimed at providing insight into how business leaders feel about the progress that’s being made toward their organizations’ sustainability commitments. For the report, produced in collaboration with Futurum Research, Honeywell surveyed more than 750 business, technology, and sustainability professionals directly involved in the planning, strategic development, implementation, or oversight of environmental sustainability goals and initiatives, at companies across multiple regions and economic sectors.
The report also included a new section examining organizations’ approaches to reporting on their environmental and social initiatives and goals, which comes as regulators in major jurisdictions around the world including Europe, the UK and the U.S., among others, have introduced or are preparing mandatory sustainability reporting requirements for companies.
According to the new disclosure-focused section of the survey, 93% respondents said that their organizations have formal plans in place for reporting on their progress towards meeting sustainability goals, and 82% said that they were “somewhat” or “extremely” optimistic about meeting sustainability reporting requirements that may emerge over the next 12 months. More than three quarters of respondents also said that it is “somewhat” or “extremely” convenient to produce a report on sustainability progress that meets requirements.
The report also unveiled an increase in the proportion of companies planning to grow spending on environmental sustainability initiatives over the next 12 months, rebounding to 86% from 83% of respondents in the prior quarter’s survey. Each of the environmental categories saw increases in planned investment, with the strongest growth in Emissions Reduction, with 85% planning to increase spend in this area, compared to 81% in the prior quarter. 86% planned to increase investment in Energy Evolution & Efficiency (85% prior quarter), 81% planned increases in Pollution Prevention spend (79% prior), and 84% for Circularity & Recycling (82% prior).
Only 1% of respondents reported plan to decrease investment over the next 12 months on environmental sustainability, compared to 3% in the prior quarter.
Despite the planned increase in spending intentions, respondents appeared slightly less confident in achieving their sustainability goals. 74% of respondents reported that they were optimistic about achieving their 2030 sustainability goals, down 3 percentage points from the prior survey, and lower across all categories, with the biggest decline in the Energy Evolution and Efficiency category, which fell to 70% from 75%.
Evan van Hook, Chief Sustainability Officer at Honeywell, said:
“The latest Environmental Sustainability Index confirms that large global companies are continuing to stay on pace and invest in technology and staff to achieve their environmental sustainability goals. Sustainability is top of mind for leadership, and they are activating top-level staff to increase involvement and traction toward goals.”

"July 19, 2023",Guest Post – Beyond Disclosures: What is the Direction of Travel for ESG Regulation – and How Could Evolving Regulatory Developments Impact your Business?,"By Michelle T Davies, EY Global Sustainability Legal Services Leader, and Ben Taylor, EY Global Strategy and Markets Leader, Climate Change and Sustainability Services
When the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) launched in 2015, its primary aim was to prevent a potential meltdown in the financial markets. Policymakers were concerned that businesses might not be effectively managing their climate-related risks, which could potentially lead to economic losses and threaten global financial stability. Accordingly, the TCFD’s recommendations promoted better reporting of climate-related financial information. The logic was that disclosure would encourage businesses to identify the climate risks they faced, plan for them, and develop initiatives to mitigate those risks. Disclosure would also help investors to make more informed capital allocation decisions and channel investment toward sustainable assets. 
The TCFD recommendations began as voluntary disclosure guidelines and are starting to be adopted more widely. In this respect, they echoed other sustainability reporting frameworks, such as those provided by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. The TCFD recommendations have rapidly either become part of the mandatory regulatory frameworks in many jurisdictions or are set to do so.
The global baseline of sustainability disclosures being developed by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), such as the recently released disclosures IFRS S1 and IFRS S2, builds on the whole set of voluntary standards, as does the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Climate change is a core focus, but sustainability standards are going much further into wider nature issues, social considerations relating to workforce and communities, and internal governance and business conduct. Having clear global standards for disclosures also benefits investors, providing a framework to assess enterprise value and make commercial decisions, including allocating capital.
From compliance to action
Initially, some financial institutions and corporations tended to treat the TCFD recommendations in the same way they had treated pre-existing sustainability frameworks – essentially as a tick-box exercise. Although organizations recognized the need to source and collate accurate sustainability data, they viewed disclosure as being fundamentally about compliance and investor relations rather than transformation.
Over time, however, that compliance mindset has been challenged by unfolding regulatory developments and increasing stakeholder pressure, especially from investors, but also from customers and employees. As a result of some notable initiatives, including the CSRD and the UK’s Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT), company leadership teams are increasingly being held to account, not just on climate but also on other sustainability issues. It is not enough to simply make disclosures. Companies are expected to properly implement their climate commitments into action – for example, through transition plans.
This shift from compliance to action presents a whole new area of legal risk for companies – a risk that currently attracts little attention beyond the general counsel’s office. As companies’ key stakeholders gain better visibility of their transition plans, they should be able to track the company’s progress against the plan. What’s more, if stakeholders – such as banks or investors – can prove that they have suffered a financial loss from relying on this information, a potential legal liability can arise.
The EU has already proposed a draft law to combat greenwashing, requiring companies that make environmental claims about their products or services to abide by minimum norms when substantiating these claims. The law aims to provide legal certainty around environmental claims and will facilitate enforcement activities around claims made.
At present, the real economy is still catching up with the shift that is taking place, however. EY research has found that just 5% of FTSE 100 businesses surveyed disclosed transition plans that would be sufficiently detailed to meet the UK government’s TPT Framework guidance and have started to put these plans into action.
Key considerations for companies
Going forward, companies will likely experience far greater scrutiny over their environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance from a wide range of stakeholders, including their auditors, banks, customers, investors, and insurers. This will put them under pressure to be genuinely transparent and to manage their data in more sophisticated ways. In due course, they also will likely need third parties to provide them with accurate data so that they can calculate their scope three emissions (emissions that arise from their value chain).
There are several ways in which your company can respond to the demands of the evolving ESG regulatory landscape. If it has not already done so, your company should consider undertaking a baseline assessment of its current carbon footprint and the climate risks facing the business. Then it will be able to set targets and metrics, and decide how it will measure and communicate progress. 
First, ensure you provide genuine visibility to your key stakeholders as you develop your plans, regularly engaging with them around transition. For example, a bank or an insurer may use your transition plan when pricing risk. But if you fail to update – or deliver on – your plan, you are likely to find that your banks and insurers will want to change the terms of their engagement with your organization, to better align their pricing and their risk. The interplay between contractual obligations and the representations made by a transition plan will be critical. 
Second, communication and transparency are essential, given that transitioning to net zero is not a linear process. To green its business, a company may need to invest in carbon-intensive projects in the short term, which reduces its carbon emissions over the longer term. It may buy and sell businesses, decommission assets, and launch new sustainability initiatives. What’s more, it will likely need to report on this process in a reliable and consistent way – which is not easy, despite the move toward more standardized frameworks. 
Inevitably market dynamics will change over time, necessitating changes to the plan. To maintain positive stakeholder engagement, it is essential to create visibility and engagement around any changes – this is about risk management and how to generate value from those changes. A prerequisite to maximizing value from the plan will likely be to ensure that it is understood by those with the ability to impact value in an organization.
Governance is also key. There are various models for providing governance around ESG, from overall board-level accountability through to sustainability committees and working groups. A vital element of governance is the overall accountability framework in the sense of who within the business has responsibility for delivering on a particular target and considering whether you have their buy-in. If you make someone accountable for delivering on a target, they should believe that target is realistic and attainable.
But accountability for delivering ESG goes well beyond individual targets. Organizations may potentially limit themselves if they “box off” sustainability to certain people or departments. For a transition plan to work, it needs to be embedded across the entire organization. Sustainability should be part of the company’s DNA – something every individual understands so that they are clear on how their behavior can have a positive or negative impact.
The finance function is critical to the governance process. Not only can it verify that the reported numbers are right; it can also ensure that sustainability targets are feasible from a financial perspective. Certain targets can be economically unviable because the technology needed to achieve them is not yet available at scale. For that reason, companies should prioritize value-led sustainability – sustainability initiatives that don’t just sound impressive but deliver real financial returns. Returns linked to cost are probably the lowest-hanging fruit – particularly costs that are priced on risk, such as insurance or bank debt.
Finally, it is crucial to operationalize sustainability throughout your business. This is much easier to achieve if you do not “box off” sustainability. The objective is for every contracting framework and process to be fit for purpose and future-proofed from a sustainability perspective. To achieve this objective, you should consider due diligence, employee engagement, mergers and acquisitions strategy and terms, supply chain management, tax structuring, and technology deployment, plus many more frameworks and processes besides – the list can go on and on. Real sustainability is about creating long-term value, which requires an element of horizon-scanning to assess what will be perceived as valuable within the relevant investment timeframe. It also requires a different mindset – recognizing that what may have been a “nice to have” approach or arrangement now needs to be legally enforceable.
Regulation is becoming a driver of real transition, both at a financial institution level and a real-economy level. By bringing visibility to companies’ transition plans, regulation helps stakeholders to properly assess the risks of engagement with a particular organization so that they can adapt the terms of their engagement or exit the relationship if required. Already, financial institutions are making it clear that they will not invest in companies that treat sustainability reporting and transition plans merely as a tick-box exercise. The shift away from ESG compliance to real transformation is happening – and it’s happening now.

The new requirements form part of Amazon’s initiatives to reach its goal to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040. Scope 3 emissions, or those originating in the company’s value chain outside of its direct control, account for over three quarters of Amazon’s emissions footprint.
In a blog post released alongside the sustainability report, Kara Hurst, Vice President and Head of Worldwide Sustainability at Amazon, said:
“Reaching net-zero carbon by 2040 requires Amazon to reduce its carbon footprint across our entire business, including our vast global supply chain. Like many companies our size, this is challenging, as these are activities that take place outside our direct operational control.”
Amazon revealed in the report that its total carbon footprint declined in 2022 by 0.4%, including a 0.7% decrease in Scope 3 emissions, despite the company’s 9% revenue growth during the year. Scope 3 emissions cuts were driven by areas including building construction, leased buildings and equipment and third-party transportation.
Hurst said:
“We know that to decrease our carbon footprint, we must work with our supply chain partners to help them decarbonize their own operations. Beginning in 2024, we’re updating our Supply Chain Standards to require suppliers to share their carbon emissions data with us and set carbon goals.”
While the company did not elaborate in the report on specific requirements or suppliers, Amazon’s Supply Chain Standards apply to all goods and services suppliers to the company and its subsidiaries, including vendors, service providers, selling partners, contractors and subcontractors.
In its report, Amazon said that it will use its size and scale to help suppliers that are committed to decarbonization by providing products and tools for tracking and decreasing emissions, and that it will help select suppliers transition to carbon-free electricity.
The company also said that it will “continue to look for suppliers that help us achieve our decarbonization vision as we select partners for business opportunities.”
The report added:
“Our potential for impact across our supply chain is big because it spans building materials, transportation, technical equipment, products, and packaging, and we look forward to having further impact in supply chain decarbonization.”
Additional highlights from the report included the company’s progress in its energy transition, with Amazon confirming that it is on track to power its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025. Amazon grew its renewable energy capacity by 8 GW in 2022, setting a record for the most announced by a company in a single year, according to the report. The company also reported that it grew its fleet of electric delivery vehicles to 9,000 in 2022, with a goal to reach 100,000 by 2030.",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT,ESGTODAY
"July 18, 2023","ING, EIB Launch €600 Million Sustainable Finance Program for SMEs","Global bank ING and the European Investment Bank (EIB) announced today the launch of a new sustainable finance program aimed at providing €600 million in new loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs ) in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to enable investments with a positive climate and environmental impact.
The fund will provide low-interest loans and leases to businesses in the Benelux region looking to make climate-focused investments, such as electric vehicles, sustainable production, and green buildings.
Saskia Bauters, Head of Business Banking Sales at ING Belgium, said:
“The agreement with the European Investment Bank allows us to offer our business customers a significant discount on interest rates for financing sustainable projects. This offer fits in perfectly with the rest of our sustainability strategy which aims to offer SMEs the push they need to choose the most sustainable solution.”
The fund is the eighth joint program between ING and the EIB aimed at Benelux SMEs since 2009, and the second focused on sustainability since 2019. Half of the funding will benefit ING’s corporate clients in the Netherlands, while the other half will support clients in Belgium and Luxembourg.
According to the banks, applications must meet ING’s credit conditions and align with sustainability goals, with eligibility criteria, based on the EU Taxonomy, ensuring funds are used for climate and environmental improvements.
Laurens de Vos, Director Business Banking at ING Netherlands, said:
“An ING survey earlier this year showed that Dutch companies want to accelerate their sustainable transition. As a bank, we want only to encourage them through easy access to finance. And the significantly discounted interest rate helps a great deal and will enable entrepreneurs to invest, for example, in electric vehicles, sustainable production methods and green buildings.”
Kris Peeters, Vice President EIB, added:
“By now it is clear to almost everyone that becoming more sustainable is a must. As Europe’s climate bank and also as part of the European Green Deal, the EIB aims to provide support and encouragement at both macro and micro level in order to green our societies. Thanks to this partnership with ING, we can also reach out to small and medium-sized enterprises and give them an extra incentive in the form of interest rate rebates.”",SUSTAINABLE FINANCE,ESGTODAY
"July 18, 2023",Bezos Earth Fund Commits $400 Million to Greening U.S. Cities,"The Bezos Earth Fund announced the launch of the Greening America’s Cities initiative, committing $400 million to support enhancing green spaces in underserved urban communities in the U.S.
The Bezos Earth Fund was founded in 2020, with a $10 billion philanthropic commitment from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, aimed at funding scientists, activists, NGOs and others driving solutions to fight climate change and protect nature.
Jeff Bezos, Executive Chair of the Bezos Earth Fund, said:
“We’re excited to help green underserved communities throughout the U.S. Working together, we can bring nature and its many benefits to every corner of our cities.”
The new initiative begins with $50 million allocated for urban greening efforts in Albuquerque, Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Wilmington, and Delaware, with more cities to be added through 2030. The program aims to enhance urban areas with more parks, trees and community garden. According to the fund, “greening” cities can increase local resilience to climate impacts such as extreme heat, reduce energy consumption, and improve physical and mental health.
Lauren Sánchez, Vice Chair of the Bezos Earth Fund, said:
“Access to nature is deeply unequal, and the importance of green spaces to underserved communities is often overlooked and unaddressed. Green spaces make a city more beautiful, livable, healthy, and joyful, but studies show that they also lower extreme summer temperatures, reducing heat stress. They support the mental and physical health of communities and even improve students’ academic performance. This $400 million commitment will impact communities across the country, making a tangible difference people can see.”",ENVIRONMENT/ INVESTORS,ESGTODAY
"July 18, 2023","EIB Commits €800 Million to Finance Climate Projects in Argentina, Brazil and Chile","The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group announced €800 million in new financing for a series of projects to support climate action in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.
The announcement was made during the European Union-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) Summit of Heads of State and Government. Each of the projects are part of the EU’s Global Gateway initiative, which aims to mobilize up to €300 billion of investments from EU institutions and member states for sustainable and high quality projects to tackle global challenges including climate change, improving health systems and boosting the security of global supply chains.
Following the EIB’s announcement, the organization has revealed two new initiatives, including a €300 million loan to Banco Santander Brasil to fund the installation of small-scale self-consumption solar photovoltaic plants on residential homes and SME business premises, and funding of €300 million to support the energy transformation in Chile by financing green mortgages and supporting green hydrogen development.
Ricardo Mourinho Félix, EIB Vice-President, said:
“I’m very pleased to announce this project with Banco Santander (Brasil) that will enable private sector investments in renewable energy, reduce carbon emissions and air pollution, and support additional renewable generation capacity in Brazil. This operation under EIB Global, the arm of the EIB created in 2022 for activities outside the European Union, builds on our global climate engagement and our support for climate action in Brazil over the last three decades.”
Werner Hoyer, President of the EIB, said:
“I am proud to see the cooperation between the European Union and Chile growing through investments in climate and new green technology. These initiatives demonstrate how Team Europe and Global Gateway can bring value to partners like Chile in their ambitious climate action agenda.”
In 2019, EIB decided to increase its level of climate and environment commitment, effectively transforming the group from being “an EU Bank supporting climate” into “The EU Climate Bank.” In 2020, the EIB’s board of directors approved the EIB Group Climate Bank Roadmap, which guides future climate action financing by the EIB and European Investment Fund (EIF), supporting €1 trillion of climate and environmental sustainability investments by 2030, and aligns all financing activities with the principles and goals of the Paris climate agreement.",SUSTAINABLE FINANCE,ESGTODAY
"July 18, 2023",Carbon Credit Ratings Provider Sylvera Raises $57 Million to Fund U.S. Expansion,"Carbon data provider Sylvera announced today that it has raised $57 million in a Series B financing, with proceeds aimed at supporting the company’s expansion into the U.S. market, and to further build out its team and platform.
The funding comes as demand for carbon offset projects and related credits is expected to increase significantly over the next several years, as companies and businesses increasingly launch net zero ambitions, and turn to offsets as a bridge to their own absolute emissions reduction efforts, or to balance difficult to avoid emissions. The unregulated and rapidly growing market faces a series of challenges, however, with market participants unable to differentiate between high and low quality projects with insufficient or inconsistent data to assess the effectiveness of the projects.
Founded in the UK in 2020, Sylvera’s carbon intelligence platform helps organizations evaluate and invest in high quality carbon credits, utilizing proprietary data and machine learning technology to produce comprehensive insights on carbon projects.
Allister Furey, CEO and co-founder of Sylvera, said:
“There is a serious lack of data to demonstrate progress against net zero targets and to prove that carbon emissions are actually being reduced or removed from the atmosphere. This uncertainty has created inaction–Sylvera is changing that. Our technology ensures funding is going to the projects, companies, and countries having maximum climate impact to get the world on track for net zero. In time, this data will create much-needed financial incentives, such as higher share prices and cheaper borrowing, for organisations taking serious net zero action.”
According to the company, proceeds from the financing will be used to support its international expansion into the U.S., with Sylvera also announcing the opening of a local New York office, as well as to build out its platform to include new data and information about carbon credits and to grow its engineering and product teams.
The Series B round was led by venture investor Balderton Capital, and included participation from existing investors Index Ventures, Insight Partners, Bain & Company, Salesforce Ventures, Speedinvest, Seedcamp, and LocalGlobe, as well as new investors Fidelity Strategic Ventures and 9Yards Capital.
Daniel Waterhouse, Partner, Balderton Capital, said:
“There is an urgent need to provide the most accurate and transparent views on the multitude of carbon projects around the world in order for corporations, governments and markets to trust in the carbon credits they are buying and effectively scale their climate contributions and head towards net zero. Sylvera has proven to be the market leader in this emerging field and we are excited to be joining them on the next phase of the journey and their work in accelerating the roll-out of data, tools and software in order to steer a path to reducing damaging climate change.”
The financing follows a $32 million series A funding round last year. Since the prior round, Sylvera said that it has seen a sevenfold growth in its customer base.
Furey and Sylvera co-founder and President Samuel Gill said:
“We launched in the UK in 2020 to help companies meet net zero goals and invest in carbon markets with confidence. Since then we’ve made significant progress in bringing transparency to the carbon markets, showing buyers what to avoid and helping to deploy capital at scale towards genuinely effective projects. In the next phase of our journey, we will bring data and transparency to overall net zero action, creating incentives for the organizations taking action and having real climate impact.”","ESG TOOLS, SERVICES/ PRIVATE EQUITY",ESGTODAY
"July 18, 2023","Guest Post: Data, Disclosures and the New Dawn of Leadership","By: Tanya Seajay, Founder and Managing Partner of 7 Centre
In 2023, CEOs face a new reality: they can no longer operate their companies in isolation. This compels them to place trust in external entities, particularly in the context of sustainability risks and opportunities.
One area where many CEOs lose confidence is in the world of data, and understandably so. The reliance on external data sources, coupled with the complexity of sustainability-related information, requires tremendous faith. However, any hesitation means another delay and a direct impact on their ability to effectively manage and capitalize on sustainability risks and opportunities.
Let’s consider the newly launched international Sustainability Standards Board’s (ISSB) IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards. Many companies are now faced with assessing and disclosing their vulnerabilities and dependence, specifically when it comes to their reliance on the world’s resources and their most valued business relationships. A company’s inaugural IFRS disclosure will arguably be one of the most significant contributions its CEO will make in the upcoming years, with annual reporting periods to begin as early as January 1st, 2024 in some jurisdictions.
Take an automobile manufacturer as an example. It operates in a complex ecosystem and is dependent on a lengthy list of resources and business relationships. Every element, from the skilled workforce to its suppliers of raw materials, now needs to be evaluated and monitored on an ongoing basis. To provide a complete disclosure, the company will likely leverage existing communication channels or create new channels that allow for open discussions on operational efficiencies, supply chain risks, shifts in customer preferences, and potential disruptions.
From this communication, it will gather data that identifies potential material impacts on cash flow, including:
Suppliers: carbon footprint of supplier’s operations, waste generated in the production process, usage of sustainable materials.
Technology partners: disposal and recycling of technological waste, consideration of lifecycle emissions in the technology selection, accessibility and inclusivity of technology solutions provided.
Dealerships: energy consumption at dealership locations, handling of end-of-life vehicles.
Customers: changing preferences for electric or hybrid vehicles, community impact of the company’s operations.
Once the data is gathered and a disclosure is filed, investors will heavily scrutinize the company’s sustainability strategies, its progress in meeting the targets its executives have set, how it manages risks, and the governance in place to stay on top of these matters. No one wants to be publicly accused of greenwashing or having a lie uncovered. CEOs and investors must trust the disclosure data completely or risk severe damage to their reputation and the company they represent.
The IFRS standards do accommodate uncertainty in matters that require “difficult, subjective, or complex judgment.” But data is still needed to weigh the many variables a CEO must consider when making these judgments.
Because of this shift, the role of data providers takes on new significance. Their accuracy and reliability become key determinants of a CEO’s confidence in decision-making. Both good and bad data will influence the world’s ability to meet its sustainability goals.
To accelerate progress, CEOs need to be self-assured. Lack of trust is a known inhibitor of progress. By fostering trust, we can expedite our commitments and build a better future.","ESG REPORTING/ ESG TOOLS, SERVICES/ GUEST POSTS",ESGTODAY
"July 18, 2023",Australia to Launch Decarbonization Plans for Key Sectors,"Australia’s Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen announced today that the government will develop sectoral decarbonization plans, starting with six key emissions-intensive sectors, aimed at supporting the government’s net zero plan and interim climate targets.
Bowen said that sectors selected for the plans include electricity and energy, industry, the built environment, agriculture and land, transport, and resources. Additionally, the waste sector will be included in the industry plan, and circular economy will be a cross-cutting issue for all sectors.
Australia’s sector decarbonization plan initiative follows the establishment into law by the Albanese government last year of Australia’s climate goals, including its targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, and to achieve net zero by 2050.
Bowen said that the Climate Change Authority, an independent body mandated to provide expert advice to the government on climate change policy had recommended underpinning the country’s net zero plan with plans for major economic sectors, and added that investor have also advised that “government-guided sectoral plans are vital for attracting billions in new investment in decarbonisation in Australia.”
To develop the plans, Bowen said that the government would work with “industry, the climate movement, experts, unions and the community,” and that the Climate Change Authority will also be requested to develop sector pathways which will help inform the plans.
Sustainability-focused investor groups welcomed the government’s new initiative to develop sector decarbonization plans. Erwin Jackson, Director, Policy at the Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC), said:
“The establishment of ‘investable’ 1.5°C pathways and goals for key economic sectors is critical to unlocking finance for climate solutions.
“Clear emissions pathways, goal posts and policy for all sectors can provide clarity for investors and the companies they own, help guide business strategy, climate-related financial disclosures, and the allocation of private capital towards new technology and infrastructure.”",ENVIRONMENT/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY
"July 18, 2023",ESG the Top Investment Priority for CFOs… and the Most Vulnerable to Near Term Budget Cuts: EY Survey,"ESG topped the list of long-term investment priorities for CFOs in a new survey released by global professional services firm EY, while paradoxically also identified as the most likely area to experience near-term budget cuts, as firms look to boost short-term results.
For the study, EY’s 2023 Global DNA of the CFO survey, EY commissioned a survey conducted by FT-Longitude of 1,000 CFOs and senior finance leaders across 21 countries and 13 industry segments, from companies with revenues greater than $1 billion.
Asked to identify their top 3 long-term investment priorities in the next three years, ESG emerged as the top choice, selected by 43% of respondents, followed by technology and digital innovation, and supply chain resilience. “Sustainability” was also reported as a top 3 priority for the transformation of organizations’ finance function over the next 3 years, with “technology transformation” and “advanced data analytics” in the top 2 spots.
The report also revealed, however, that 50% of the finance leaders said that they are meeting short-term earnings targets by cutting funding in areas identified as long-term priorities, with ESG at the top of the list, with 37% planning a near-term cut or pause in spending in ESG, followed by technology and digital innovation, and talent and culture at 34% each.
The need to create long-term value while facing pressure to cut priority investment areas was one of the paradoxes facing CFOs identified in the report, and a key tension area reported by the finance leaders. Two thirds of respondents said that there were disagreements within their leadership teams over the balance between short- and long-term priorities.
This tension appears most significant for ESG, with the number one challenge – identified by 32% of respondents – reported in this area being “significant differences of opinion within our leadership team on how to balance short-term financial performance with long-term investments into sustainability priorities.”
According to EY, the impact of the short- and long-term priority imbalance fits with the results of another recent study, the EY 2022 Global Corporate Reporting and Institutional Investor Survey, I which 80% of investors reported that “too many companies fail to properly articulate the rationale for long-term investments in sustainability.”
The new EY survey highlighted the results of a “bolder cohort” of finance leaders within the survey respondents, who reported that they were pursuing efforts to significantly evolve how the finance function operates in their organizations, and were embracing digitization and culture change, as well as the development of the next generation of finance leaders. Within this cohort, 51% reported prioritizing long-term ESG investment, compared to 42% of other respondents, and nearly half (46%) said that they “strongly agree” that ESG and sustainability has increased attention on managing for the long-term. This same group, however, were also even more likely to report a near-term investment cut or pause in climate change and ESG, at 44%.
Myles Corson, EY Global and EY Americas Strategy and Markets Leader, Financial Accounting Advisory Services (FAAS), said:
“CFOs should articulate a strategy for long-term value while setting achievable targets and implementing effective performance management. Transforming the finance function will likely require a cultural shift, fostering new mindsets and behaviors within the team.”

The move would open up the program enabling investors to control their own proxy voting choices to over three million shareholder accounts of the S&P 500 exchange traded fund.
Joud Abdel Majeid, Global Head of BlackRock Investment Stewardship, said:
“BlackRock is committed to a future where every investor can have the choice to participate in the shareholder voting process. While many asset owners choose to rely on BlackRock’s Investment Stewardship team to engage and execute voting on their behalf, consistent with our fiduciary duty as an investment manager, others want the choice to participate in proxy voting more directly.”
The announcement follows the introduction of the BlackRock Voting Choice program in 2021, beginning with certain institutional clients, including pension funds, insurance companies and corporations, in certain accounts managed in the US and UK. BlackRock has been working to expand the program, with the firm indicating last year that it planned to extend voting choice to individual investors.
With the expansion of the program to the S&P 500 ETF, Voting Choice would be open to $2.3 trillion of BlackRock’s total index equity AUM, or more than half of the firm’s global index AUM.
Interest has been strong, with BlackRock indicating that clients representing more than 25% of Voting Choice eligible assets have committed to the program as of Q1 2023.
Under the new program, eligible investors would be offered a series third-party policies, which would be used to split proxy voting ballots based on pro-rata fund ownership. Investors would also be offered the option to continue to vote according to the BlackRock Investment Stewardship policy.
The firm said that it will use the S&P 500 ETF pilot program to assess investor interest, the proxy voting infrastructure and user experience, in order to evaluate further expanding the program.

"July 17, 2023",Australia Releases Rules for Sustainability Claims to Fight Greenwashing by Companies,"Australia’s competition regulator the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) announced the publication of new environmental and sustainability claims draft guidance, aimed at improving the integrity of green claims made by companies and protecting consumers from greenwashing.
The new guidance follows the publication of a study by ACCC earlier this year that found that 57% of companies examined made concerning claims about their environmental credentials. Following the release of the study, the regulator said that it will be investigating companies for potential greenwashing, and that it will conduct education activities with businesses and update guidance to help improve the integrity of environmental claims.
ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said:
“False or misleading claims can undermine consumer trust in all green claims, particularly when consumers are often paying higher prices based on these claims.
“Similarly, businesses that are taking genuine steps to adopt sustainable practices are put at a competitive disadvantage by businesses that engage in ‘greenwashing’ without incurring the same costs.”
Cass-Gottlieb said that the new guidance “sets out what the ACCC considers to be good practice when businesses make environmental claims about their products and services.”
The rules set out for businesses are focused on eight key principles, including ensuring that any environmental claims accurate, true and factually correct; having evidence to back up claims; not hiding important information; explaining any conditions or qualifications for green claims; avoiding broad and unqualified claims (such as “eco-friendly” or “sustainable”); using clear and easily understandable language; ensuring that visual elements, and being direct and open about the company’s sustainability transition.
The draft guidance also includes details on ACCC’s compliance and enforcement approach, including noting that penalties for making false or misleading representations could include fines of as much as $50 million, or three times the assessed value of the benefit from the contravention.
Cass-Gottlieb said:
“If you make a claim about the environmental or sustainability benefits of your product or service – make sure it’s right, and if you are unsure or can’t substantiate these claims, then don’t make the claim.”
The consultation for the ACCC’s new draft guidance is open until September 15.

"July 17, 2023",Biden Launches $20 Billion Climate and Clean Tech Project Financing Programs,"The Biden administration announced the launch of two new programs through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and totaling $20 billion, aimed at financing climate and clean energy projects at the community and small business level.
The new programs are being established under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, created through last year’s Inflation Reduction Act, and designed to mobilize financing and private capital to combat climate change. The fund consists of three programs, including the two new initiatives, and a $7 billion program launched last month to deploy residential and community solar projects, with a focus on low-income communities.
In a speech at Baltimore’s Coppin State University announcing the new program, Vice President Kamala Harris said:
“For years, one of the missing pieces in our strategy to fight the climate crisis is that we have not invested at scale in community climate action… Today, I am proud to announce the largest investment in financing for community-based climate projects in our nation’s history.”
The new programs include the $14 billion National Clean Investment Fund, which will provide grants to new national non-profit clean financing institutions to partner with the private sector in providing capital to fund tens of thousands of clean technology projects in homes, businesses and communities. According to the EPA, at least 40% of the funds from the program will be dedicated to low-income and disadvantaged communities.
The administration also launched the $6 billion Clean Communities Investment Accelerator, which will provide funding and technical assistance to local build the clean financing capacity of community lenders, such as community banks, with 100% of the program’s funds dedicated to low-income and disadvantaged communities.
According to Vice President Harris, types of projects that could be funded under the new programs could include providing capital to construction companies to enable the installation of energy-efficient appliances in new housing projects, or helping small business owners receive zero-interest loans to electrify a delivery fleet.
The Biden administration has made climate action a key focus, beginning with the return of the U.S. to the Paris Agreement on the president’s first day in office, committing the country to achieve net zero by 2050, and following up with an interim target to reduce economy-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) emission by 50-52% in 2030. 
Harris said:

"July 13, 2023",BNP Paribas AM Votes Against More than Half of Company Climate Plans,"BNP Paribas Asset Management (BNPP AM) announced its 2023 AGM season voting record, revealing that it rejected more than half of corporate climate strategy – or “Say on Climate” – resolutions, and opposed nearly half of director appointments, primarily for diversity reasons.
Say on Climate resolutions are typically non-binding advisory votes on company’s climate transition plans. BNP Paribas AM said that it noted a sharp decline in the number of climate  resolutions in the 2023 AGM season, and said that it voted against 53% of the plans, with a focus on Scope 3 emissions. The firm’s voting policy takes into consideration several factors when assessing Say on Climate resolutions, including whether the company discloses all relevant emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3, sets an ambition to reach net zero by 2050, as well as short- and medium-term targets that address the most relevant emission scopes, and report in line with TCFD standards on climate governance, strategy, risk management and metrics, and targets.
BNP Paribas AM also said that it rejected 48% of director appointment resolutions, with most due to companies missing the firm’s voting policy’s board diversity targets, including a requirement for 35% female representation in Europe and North America, and 20% in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East. The company said that it opposed the election of all male directors at companies that did not meet its thresholds.
Additionally, the firm said that it rejected 55% of executive compensation resolutions, noting that while it has seen an improvement in the transparency and integration of ESG performance criteria, it continues to see variable remuneration without performance requirements and “an excessive catch-up effect compared to 2022,” which was affected by the pandemic. Under BNP Paribas AM’s voting policy, the firm will not vote for compensation practices that have executive remuneration schemes disproportionate to median employee pay, misaligned with performance or allowing “pay-for-failure,” or that do not include ESG performance criteria.
BNP Paribas AM added that it rejected more than 1,000 resolutions overall for reasons including a lack of credible decarbonization strategies and intermediate targets, and failure of companies to assess and report on their main impacts and dependencies on nature, particularly on water and deforestation issues.
Michael Herskovich, Head of Voting and Governance at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said:
“In the first half of the year, BNPP AM voted at more than 1,600 AGMs worldwide.  Voting is an important component of our dialogue with the companies in which we invest on behalf of our clients, as well as being an integral part of our investment management processes.”",INVESTORS,ESGTODAY
"July 13, 2023","Exxon Acquires Denbury, Including World’s Largest CO2 Pipeline Network, for $5 Billion","Energy giant ExxonMobil announced today an agreement to acquire carbon capture and CO2 utilization-focused energy company Denbury in a deal valued at $4.9 billion, in a deal the company said will help it accelerate its low-carbon opportunities and provide carbon capture services to hard-to-decarbonize industries.
Denbury’s primary business is producing oil, with a focus on developing stranded reserves from depleted reserves through the injection of captured industrial-sourced CO2. The company said that it has achieved net negative Scope 1 and 2 emissions with a goal to reach net zero across all scopes by 2030.
While the company achieved 2.5 million tons net negative Scope 1 and 2 emissions, however, its Scope 3 emissions are still significantly larger, exceeding 11 million tons in 2021, according to Denbury’s most recent Corporate Responsibility Report.
Denbury also has a significant focus on carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCS) solutions, with the world’s largest owned and operated 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline network and a growing portfolio of properties for carbon sequestration.
ExxonMobil Chairman and CEO Darren Woods said:
“Acquiring Denbury reflects our determination to profitably grow our Low Carbon Solutions business by serving a range of hard-to-decarbonize industries with a comprehensive carbon capture and sequestration offering. The breadth of Denbury’s network, when added to ExxonMobil’s decades of experience and capabilities in CCS, gives us the opportunity to play an even greater role in a thoughtful energy transition, as we continue to deliver on our commitment to provide the world with the vital energy and products it needs.”
The deal follows Exxon’s announcement last year of plans to invest more than $15 billion over the next six years to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in its operations, and in lower-emission business opportunities to help customers reduce emissions. The company established a Low Carbon Solutions business in 2021, focused on areas including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels.
Dan Ammann, President, ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions, said:
“Denbury’s advantaged CO2 infrastructure provides significant opportunities to expand and accelerate ExxonMobil’s low-carbon leadership across our Gulf Coast value chains. Once fully developed and optimized, this combination of assets and capabilities has the potential to profitably reduce emissions by more than 100 million metric tons per year in one of the highest-emitting regions of the U.S.”
Chris Kendall, Denbury’s President and CEO added:
“Over the last few years, Denbury has made significant progress executing our strategic plan, strengthening our enhanced oil recovery operations and capitalizing on our unrivaled infrastructure to accelerate the growth of our CO2 transportation and storage business. To build even further on this positive momentum, the Denbury Board of Directors and management team undertook a thorough review process and considered a number of alternatives to maximize long-term value. Through this process, it became clear that the transaction with ExxonMobil is in the best interests of our company, our shareholders, and all Denbury stakeholders.”",COMPANIES/ ENERGY TRANSITION/ M&A,ESGTODAY

"July 13, 2023",Amundi Votes Against 500 Directors over Climate Strategy Concerns,"Leading European asset manager Amundi revealed today that it has opposed the re-election of more than 500 directors at 84 companies in the Energies & Utilities sectors so far this year, over concerns about their companies’ climate strategies, representing more than 20% of re-election candidates in those sectors.
The firm also stated that it voted against executive remuneration-related proposals at 89 oil & gas and utilities companies, over their failure to include climate-related performance criteria in senior management variable compensation schemes.
The announcement follows the publication of a new voting policy by Amundi earlier this year with board accountability and executive remuneration criteria. In the policy, Amundi said that it “will be vigilant on the inclusion of ESG criteria in the variable remuneration,” and will require companies in climate mitigation risk-exposed sectors – such as oil & gas, utilities, mining, transportation, cement, steel & aluminium, construction, industrials, and infrastructure – to include climate-related criteria in variable remuneration metrics.
The voting policy also states that “Amundi views favorably shareholder resolutions asking issuers to increase transparency on environmental and social issues.” Amundi said that in the 2023 voting season, it has supported 88% of climate-related shareholder proposals.
In a statement announcing its recent voting, Amundi saiid:
“We firmly believe in active and constructive dialogue with issuers to positively influence their overall strategy, and push them in an ambitious environmental transition journey. Stewardship is a powerful way to influence company’s understanding and disclosure of environmental and social issues. It is also a way to contribute to strategy changes that will result in real-life outcomes and long term sustainable value creation.”
Increasing stewardship activity forms a key part of Amundi’s 2025 ESG Ambition plan, which the company launched in 2021, which included a goal to engage with 1,000 additional companies on climate strategies. In the company’s recently released 2022 Engagement Report, Amundi revealed that it is on track to meet this target, with 418 new companies engaged on climate in 2022, taking the total number to 882.

"July 12, 2023","Rio Tinto, Sumitomo to Produce Low-Carbon Alumina by Replacing Natural Gas with Hydrogen","Global mining and metals company Rio Tinto announced today a partnership with Sumitomo to build a pilot plant at Rio Tinto’s Yarwun Alumina Refinery in Queensland, Australia, aimed at reducing the carbon intensity of alumina production.
The pilot project, Yarwun Hydrogen Calcination Pilot Demonstration Program, aims to demonstrate the viability of using hydrogen in the calcination process, testing whether hydrogen could replace natural gas in Rio Tinto’s refineries.
The project is part of a A$111 million (USD$75 million) program to lower carbon emissions from the alumina refining process. The companies approved the project after receiving A$32 million in co-funding from the Australian government’s Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).
Hydrogen is viewed as one of the key building blocks of the transition to a cleaner energy future, particularly for sectors with difficult to abate emissions, in which renewable energy solutions such as wind or solar are less practical.
Rio Tinto has set climate goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% by 2025 and 50% by 2030, and to achieve net zero by 2050. According to the company’s 2022 Climate Change Report, bauxite and alumina account for more than 20% of the company’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions, with reductions in alumina process heat set as one of the company’s key focus areas for hitting its 2030 goal.
Rio Tinto Aluminium Pacific Operations Managing Director Armando Torres said:
“At Rio Tinto we have put the energy transition at the heart of our business strategy, and this is one of the ways we’re working towards decarbonising our operations.”
In the calcination process, the last step in the alumina refining process, hydrated alumina is heated to temperatures of up to 1,000 degrees Celsius to remove chemically bound water that is associated with alumina.
According to ARENA, calciners, which traditionally operate on natural gas account for approximately 30% of greenhouse gas emissions from alumina refineries.
The new project aims to abate emissions from the process by substituting natural gas with hydrogen. The project involves constructing a hydrogen plant at the refinery, including a 2.5MW on-site electrolyser, and retrofitting account for approximately 30% of greenhouse gas emissions from alumina refineries.
The electrolyser will be owned and operated by Sumitomo, and the hydrogen will be supplied directly to Rio Tinto.
The pilot project is expected to produce the equivalent of about 6,000 tonnes of alumina per year, and if successful, “could pave the way for adoption of the technology at scale globally,” the companies said, adding that converting the entire plant to green hydrogen could reduce emissions by 500,000 tonnes per year.
Construction is anticipated to begin in 2024, with the new hydrogen plant and calciner expected to be operational in 2025.
Sumitomo Corporation Energy Innovation Initiative Director, Seiji Kitajima said:
“Demonstrating real-world applications of hydrogen in industrial settings with motivated partners is essential to reducing carbon emissions and working toward our company’s vision of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Through this demonstration, Sumitomo Corporation aims to venture into the commercialisation project to contribute to Rio Tinto’s decarbonisation.”",COMPANIES/ ENERGY TRANSITION,ESGTODAY
"July 12, 2023",Nature Restoration Law Narrowly Survives in EU Parliament Vote,"A proposed EU law aimed at restoring and protecting natural habitats and ecosystem narrowly survived in a rejection vote in the European Parliament, enabling the legislation to proceed to the negotiation stage between Parliament and the EU Council.
The proposed Nature Restoration Law was introduced by the European Commission in June 2022, aimed at enabling a sustained recovery of degraded ecosystems, as well as contributing to the EU’s climate objectives, and forming a key element of the EU Biodiversity Strategy.
The proposed law contains several targets covering areas including the improvement and re-establishment of biodiverse habitats in wetlands, grasslands, forests, rivers and lakes and other ecosystems, reversing the decline of pollinating insect populations, maintaining green urban space, restoring drained peatland under agricultural use, and restoring marine habitats, among others.
A campaign pushing back against the proposed law led by the European People’s Party (EPP), however, put the future of the law in jeopardy, with the European Parliament’s Environment committee’s vote on its proposed version of the law failing to reach a majority last month, and a motion to reject the law tabled for a full vote in Parliament.
Opponents of the law raised a series of objections, including claims that the proposals would threaten food security and agriculture, and would work against Europe’s clean energy and climate goals, by reducing capacity of energy sources such as hydropower and biomass.
The motion to reject the proposals was defeated in a narrow 312 to 324 vote, with 12 abstentions.
Parliament went on to adopt its position in a 336 to 300 vote, with 13 abstentions, although the adopted text included several adjustments aimed at addressing opponents’ concerns, including the addition of a new article stating that new renewable energy infrastructure installations overwhelmingly in the public interest, ensuring that the new law does not block such projects. Parliament also said that the new law will only apply when the EU Commission provides data on conditions necessary to guarantee long-term food security.
Following the vote, rapporteur César Luena said:
“Our position adopted today sends a clear message. Now we must continue the good work, defend our ground during the negotiations with member states and reach an agreement before the end of this Parliament’s mandate to pass the first regulation on nature restoration in the EU’s history.”",ENVIRONMENT/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY

"July 12, 2023",Guest Post: What Will Sustainability 2.0 Look Like?,"Dr. Matthew Bell, EY Global Climate Change & Sustainability Services Leader, explains why exponential, not incremental, change is needed ahead.
To get a better perspective on the future, let’s begin by looking at the past. Over the last two decades, sustainability has undoubtedly helped to introduce “greener” business practices, but many would argue that these have been largely incremental, from boosting energy efficiency to building trust with consumers and regulators.
Now, as the window in which environmental disaster can be averted narrows, sustainability professionals are increasingly aware that something less incremental and more fundamental will be required. Part of this shift is the realization that even best-practice sustainability strategies can still be at odds with environmental goals if the organization’s business model is not aligned.
This disconnect between sustainability targets and business models may well explain why terms like greenwashing, greenwishing and greenhushing[1] have taken hold. For even the most well-intentioned business, living up to your green claims is tough if your business model could actually be working against them. Perhaps that’s one reason why, in recent research, EY analysis found that while 80% of FTSE 100 companies publicly committed themselves to reaching net-zero by 2050, in reality only 5% had credible net-zero plans[2].
New models, new ways of thinking
Sustainability 2.0 is likely to mean moving from tinkering with existing models to exploring new ones.
That’s largely driven by the fact that most existing business models fail to consider planetary limits because they are based on unconstrained access to resources to produce an ever-growing supply of products. While the environmental cost per unit can be reduced, if the model is predicated on producing ever more products for a growing customer base, then those planetary limits will still be in danger.
So, what do these new models look like?
The models are essentially based on three schools of thought, which I will briefly summarise.
A world of constraint: This model posits that businesses and indeed society need to restrain and reduce consumption in order to live within planetary limits.
A circular world: This model maintains that if businesses deploy more circular models, which eliminate waste through everything from energy efficiency to recycling, society can continue to consume as much as we desire.
A world of (sustainable) growth: A third view is one that economist Tyler Cowen sets out in his book Stubborn Attachments. This philosophy allows for the pursuit of growth, but only when that growth doesn’t have a deleterious effect on any person or anything at any point in the future.
That focus on the long-term future is key here because it can be at odds with investors’ and economists’ tendency to prioritize shorter-term goals, or discount events that occur some years into the future.
Sustainability 2.0 will inevitably mean revisiting capital and business models. When doing so, we will need to carefully consider how businesses can think much more long term while still meeting the current needs of stakeholders. If we can’t do this, what is the alternative? Should companies with unsustainable business models have a “useful life,” rather than exist in perpetuity?
Setting out on a fresh path
So, faced with such a seismic shift, where should businesses begin?
The crucial starting point is materiality, a term both familiar to businesses and within the scope of existing European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CRSD) regulations. It means carefully examining not only how an individual business impacts environmental, social, and economic matters, but also how these matters could financially impact the business. While this may be a relatively well-established process, the game-changer occurs when the so-called double materiality is properly incorporated into the company’s strategy and risk register. This can be a powerful process because those risks – from cutting off access to vital resources to being unable to comply with regulations or even losing a social license to operate – will now be seen as fundamental to business survival. Once that happens, changes to the business model begin to look less abstract and more pressing.
Sustainability 2.0 may impact even the most core aspects of established thinking, not least in expanding the concept of value beyond its traditional economic monetary meaning to encompass social and environmental value. As if that isn’t a big enough shift in mindset, collaboration could begin to replace competition as businesses come together to create innovative and disruptive cross-sector sustainability initiatives. We’re already seeing this trend reflected in the rise of the ecosystem, with recent EY research[3] showing that companies are generating significant value as a result.
A change of role for sustainability professionals
One final reflection on what sustainability 2.0 will look like relates to the role of sustainability professionals. Here, rather as I’m suggesting businesses should do, I’ve changed my previous view of the world. I, like others in the profession, believed that as sustainability became more integral to business, it would no longer be a distinct discipline or department, just a natural element of any successful company or role. Happily, we would all be out of a job.
Now, though, I see that sustainability professionals are not only more needed than ever, but their highly demanding roles must act as an essential bridge between the inertia for a shorter-term focus of businesses and the long-term needs and risks of the planet. In this particular vision of the future, the sustainability function becomes a co-pilot to the CEO, the CFO, and Risk and Strategy leads, equipped with a much more cognizant view of the long-time horizon. Chief Future Officer perhaps?

"July 12, 2023",EU Unveils New Regulations to Decarbonize Freight Transport,"The European Commission unveiled a new series of proposed measures aimed at improving the efficiency and sustainability of the freight transport sector, including the introduction of rules aimed at accelerating the shift to electric heavy duty vehicles, attracting more freight shipping to rail, and helping shipping companies to communicate their carbon footprint.
The new measures form part of the EU’s strategy to decarbonize the transport sector, as part of the European Green Deal, the EU plan to transform the region into a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy and achieve climate neutrality by 2050.
The EU’s climate strategy includes a goal to cut transport emissions by 90% by 2050. Freight is responsible for around 30% of transport emissions, which are expected to grow by 50% by 2050 without putting in place decarbonization measures, according to the Commission. Around 53% of freight in the EU is carried by road.
The new regulations announced by the Commission include a proposal to revise the EU’s Weights and Dimensions Directive, which sets the maximum weight length, width and height for heavy-duty vehicles, to allow additional weight for vehicles using zero-emission technologies, which typically increase vehicle weight. According to the Commission, the revision would help incentivize the take-up of cleaner vehicles, and enable zero-emission vehicles to benefit from carrying additional payloads as technology develops and becomes lighter.
The proposals also include measures to optimize the use of rail transport, including improving cross-border coordination, increased punctuality and reliability, in order to attract more freight companies to rail, which only currently carries roughly 12% of goods transported between EU countries. The new proposal includes incentives for infrastructure managers and rail undertakings aimed at better coordinating the use of railway infrastructure capacity in the single European railway area, and move away from the current fragmented approach, which often leads to border delays.
The Commission also proposed a common approach for shipping companies to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions, based on the new ISO/CEN standard, enabling companies to communicate their emissions footprint on a standardized, comparable basis to shippers.
Frans Timmermans, Executive Vice-President for the European Green Deal, said:
“With today’s proposals, we take another step on the journey to sustainable transport. Every day, billions of goods are traveling on European roads and railway tracks, from harbours and customs points to shops and to our homes. Our proposals will help to get more zero-emission trucks on the road and make sure that this freight is handled in the most sustainable way possible, whether it travels by truck, train or barge.”",ENVIRONMENT/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY
"July 12, 2023",Half of Board Members Report Lacking Skills to Address Climate Issues: WTW/Nasdaq Survey,"Nearly half of board members report lacking skills and expertise in their organizations for addressing climate issues, even as most acknowledge that a strong ESG strategy can lead to better financial outcomes, according to a new survey by advisory, broking and solutions company WTW and the Nasdaq Center for Board Excellence.
For the study, the Fostering Corporate Governance and Enhancing Board Effectiveness Survey, WTW and Nasdaq surveyed 349 board members across 44 countries.
The survey found that most board members recognized value in sustainability-focused initiatives, with 75% of respondents agreeing that “a coherent environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy helps to create sustainable organizational value and stronger financial outcomes,” and “alignment with the organization’s business strategy” scoring as the most common factor influencing board members to prioritize ESG themes, cited by 85%.
Additional factors influencing the prioritizing of ESG factors included ethical reasons, by 78% of respondents, followed by long-term value creation, reputation and risk mitigation, while regulatory compliance placed only 6th, cited by 71%.
By ESG focus area, top priorities cited by respondents included human capital at 82% followed by governance at 70%, while only half ranked environmental and climate in their top-three priorities.
Despite acknowledging the value of a strong ESG strategy, many board members said that their organization’s don’t focus enough on sustainability issues, with fewer than two-thirds of (62%) of respondents agreeing that their boards have dedicated sufficient time and resources to governance of their ESG priorities.
Similarly, board oversight of ESG issues appears to be evolving, with an expectation for more specialist responsibilities in the future. While more than half of respondents reported that oversight of ESG governance is performed by a combination of the full board and other committees, 61% of these respondents also said that they expect to see a dedicated ESG or sustainability committee in the next three years, although 71% also acknowledged that some ESG oversight will continue to be a full board matter.
In addition to evolving oversight, boards also appear to expect to invest in ESG-related skills and education. While 48% of respondents reported lacking skills and expertise for addressing climate issues, only 18% expected this skills gap to remain in three years.
Kenneth Kuk, Senior Director, Work & Rewards at WTW said:
“Board members are evolving their ESG agenda from reacting to stakeholder pressure to proactively linking ESG to business strategy. As a result, we are seeing greater interest in addressing skills and resource gaps and more emphasis on oversight of emerging risks.”

"July 11, 2023",EU Markets Regulator Announces Expectations for Sustainability Disclosure in Prospectuses,"EU markets regulator the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) announced today the publication of its expectations for sustainability-related disclosures in equity and non-equity prospectuses.
The regulator said that the guidance is aimed at supporting investors’ ability to make informed investment decisions, providing issuers with an understanding of disclosures regulators will expect them to provide, and ensuring a coordinated approach towards scrutinizing sustainability-related disclosures by national competent authorities (national-level regulatory authorities, or NCAs).
Among the guidelines included in ESMA’s statement is an expectation for issuers to provide the basis for any statements concerning their sustainability profile, such as referring to underlying data or assumptions, detailing specific market standards or labels, or referencing third party research or analysis.
For equity prospectuses, the statement expects inclusion of reporting in accordance with the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), the current EU sustainability reporting framework, or its upcoming update, the Corporate Sustainable Reporting Directive (CSRD), to the extent that the disclosures are material.
The statement also includes guidance for prospectuses for “use of proceeds” bonds and sustainability-linked bonds. For bonds such as green, social and sustainability bonds, ESMA said that prospectuses should include disclosure regarding the use of proceeds, along with information enabling investors to assess the ambition underlying project evaluation and selection. Information to be provided in prospectuses for sustainability-linked bonds includes details about selected key performance indicators (KPIs) and sustainability performance targets (SPTs), as well as information enabling assessment of the consistency of KPIs and SPTs with relevant science-based targets and the issuer’s sustainability strategy.
ESMA also noted that it has observed “that some issuers include sustainability-related disclosure in their advertisements that is not included in their prospectus,” and that this information should be included in prospectuses if material, adding that “the importance of the sustainability-related disclosure in the advertisement for investors is an indicator of its materiality.”

"July 11, 2023",Carbon Removal Startup CarbonCure Raises $80 Million for Concrete Decarbonization Solution,"Carbon removal technology company CarbonCure Technologies announced today that it has raised $80 million in a new equity round, with proceeds aimed at scaling the company’s emissions reduction solutions for the concrete sector and growing its supply of carbon credits.
Buildings are a key source of environmental and climate impact, generating nearly 40% of annual global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and embodied carbon, or carbon emitted from the manufacturing of building materials and construction accounting for around half of carbon emissions from new construction. Cement production, a key ingredient in concrete, accounting for approximately 8% of global carbon dioxide emissions, with over 900 kg of CO2 emissions generated for every 1000 kg of material produced.
Founded in 2012, Halifax, Nova Scotia-based CarbonCure provides solutions that let concrete producers use captured carbon dioxide to produce low carbon concrete mixes.  The company’s technology is retrofitted into concrete plants to allow producers to inject captured CO2 into fresh concrete during mixing, in a process that mineralizes the CO2 while also increasing the concrete’s strength.
According to the company, its technologies have already produced almost five million truckloads of low-carbon concrete, saving about 290,000 metric tons of CO2, equivalent to removing over 64,000 gas-powered cars from the road for a year.
Robert Niven, Chair and CEO of CarbonCure Technologies, said:
“Our solutions help concrete producers deliver high quality, lower carbon concrete in an efficient, economical and non-disruptive way. With more than 750 systems sold, this latest investment will drive CarbonCure’s deployment across the global concrete industry as the private sector doubles down on sustainability in new construction and as federal, state and even municipal procurement policies requiring green building materials continue to multiply.”
The financing round was led by specialist impact investor Blue Earth Capital, and included participation from existing investors including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Taronga Ventures, Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, and 2150, as well as new investors BH3 Growth Equity (BH3) and Samsung Ventures (Corporate VC fund backed by Samsung C&T).
Kayode Akinola, Head of Private Equity at Blue Earth Capital, said:
“As part of our Climate Growth Strategy, we look to support promising technologies and companies enabling the redesign or supplementation of major industrial processes by using lower carbon-intensive materials and/or enabling raw materials to be reused. Solutions like these are urgently needed to help meet global climate goals.”",ENVIRONMENT/ PRIVATE EQUITY,ESGTODAY

"July 11, 2023",ESG Rises to #2 Top Priority for Procurement Execs: Deloitte Survey,"ESG has become a key focus area for procurement executives around the world, rising to the #2 spot of top priorities in a new survey by global professional services firm Deloitte, up from 7th place in the prior 2021 study.
For the report, the 2023 Global Chief Procurement Officer Survey, Deloitte surveyed approximately 350 procurement leaders from more than 40 countries. Deloitte has been conducting the Global CPO survey since 2011.
The increase in ESG prioritization among procurement leaders comes as companies globally face increasing regulatory and stakeholder pressure to manage and report on a variety of sustainability factors, and as the focus of these initiatives increasingly turns to companies’ value chains, covering factors such as Scope 3 emissions and human rights in upstream supply chains.
The EU’s proposed corporate sustainability due diligence directive (CSDDD), for example, includes rules requiring large businesses to assess and address adverse human rights and environmental impacts in their value chains, while the ISSB’s new global climate reporting standard, will require reporting on emissions across the corporate value chain.   
The report noted the key role of the procurement function in driving the sustainability agenda, pointing out that “ESG is the top area where procurement plays an active influential role in decision-making (85% of firms), with corporate risk management and FP&A next (roughly 70%).”
The report added:
“Procurement’s role in delivering value here can mean something as narrow as baseline compliance to the regulations, but it can also mean many other things, including identifying more carbon efficient suppliers.”
Overall, 72% of respondents cited “enhancing ESG/CSR” as a top enterprise priority, second only to “driving operational efficiency” at 74%, and tied with “digital transformation.”
Key ESG factors targeted by CPOs in the survey included waste reduction and material circularity, at 72%, followed by climate mitigation at 62%.
While ESG rises in the list of priorities for procurement professionals, the study indicated that initiatives to quantify the sustainability factors remains at an early stage. Although 60% of respondents said that they measure suppliers on sustainability at some level, and 63% reported collaborating with suppliers on ESG initiatives, far less than half (40%) said that their procurement organizations don’t define or measure their own set of relevant ESG factors.
The survey also highlighted key ESG-related investment focus areas for the CPOs, with top areas identified as assessments, the development of visibility and reporting platforms, the creation of supplier investment funds and consortia, and the incorporation of ESG into core people, process, and consulting/ transformation support.
The report said:
“ESG support is a critical C-suite issue for CPOs to support and one they should arguably be using to their advantage. It includes renewing ways to engage and collaborate with suppliers to balance cost, resiliency, ESG, and other factors.”","REPORTS, STUDIES",ESGTODAY
"July 10, 2023",IFRS to Take Over Responsibilities of the TCFD,"The IFRS Foundation’s International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) will take over responsibility for monitoring progress of companies’ climate-related disclosures from the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as of next year, following a request from the FSB.
The transfer of responsibilities marks a significant step in the ongoing consolidation of sustainability reporting standards, following the publication last month of the ISSB’s global standards for sustainability and climate reporting.
The TCFD was established by the FSB in 2015, with the goal of developing consistent disclosure standards for companies, in order to enable investors and other stakeholders to assess the companies’ climate-related financial risk. The recommendations were published in June 2017, and have until now effectively been serving as the industry standard for climate-related disclosure.
The TCFD recommendations were also broadly incorporated into the requirements of the ISSB’s climate related disclosure standard.
The ISSB was launched in November 2021 at the COP26 climate conference, with the goal to develop IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, driven by demand from investors, companies, governments and regulators to provide a global baseline of disclosure requirements enabling a consistent understanding of the effect of sustainability risks and opportunities on companies’ prospects.
In its plenary meeting last week, the FSB said that the publication of the new ISSB standards “can be seen as a culmination of the work of the TCFD.”
The FSB added that it “thanked the TCFD for its work over the years and the major contribution it has made to the progress in improving climate-related financial disclosures around the world,” and requested that the work of monitoring and reporting on progress in companies’ climate-related disclosures be taken over by the ISSB following the delivery of the TCFD’s 2023 annual status report.
In a statement from the IFRS Foundation confirming that it will take over the TCFD’s responsibilities, ISSB Chair Emmanuel Faber said:
“The ISSB has built from and consolidated the market-leading investor-focused sustainability-reporting initiatives to deliver the ISSB Standards, with the TCFD recommendations at the heart of this. As such, the ISSB welcomes the FSB’s request to transfer the TCFD’s monitoring responsibilities to the ISSB from 2024 and the opportunity to build on TCFD’s legacy. This announcement provides yet further clarification of the so-called ‘alphabet soup’ of ESG initiatives for companies and investors.”",ESG REPORTING,ESGTODAY

"July 10, 2023",Singapore Proposes Mandatory Climate Reporting for both Public and Private Companies,"Public and large private companies in Singapore will be required to provide climate-related disclosures aligned with the IFRS’ newly published ISSB disclosure standards, according to a proposal by Singapore’s business reporting, accounting and corporate services and markets regulators Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) and Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo).
The plan for mandatory climate-related reporting was recommended by the Sustainability Reporting Advisory Committee (SRAC), jointly launched by the regulators last year to advise on a sustainability reporting roadmap for Singapore companies.
According to a statement by the regulators, the proposal for mandatory climate reporting aims to maintain Singapore’s position as a global business hub, while also contributing to the Singapore Green Plan 2030, the government’s sustainable transition strategy aimed at strengthening Singapore’s commitment to the UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.
ACRA Assistant Chief Executive Kuldip Gill said:
“Trusted and consistent climate reporting is essential to drive accountability and decisive actions by companies. It will also rally companies towards contributing to Singapore’s net zero emissions commitments, expediting our transition to a green economy.”
Currently, Singapore only requires listed companies in select sectors including finance, agriculture, food, forest products and energy to provide TCFD-aligned climate reporting, with all other listed issuers required to apply TCFD on a ‘comply-or-explain’ basis.
Under the new proposals, all listed issuers, including those incorporated overseas, as well as business trusts and REITs, would be required to report climate-related disclosures beginning in fiscal year 2025, with non-listed companies with at least $1 billion in revenues beginning in FY2027.
The regulators added that they plan to conduct a review in 2027 on plans to extend the climate disclosure requirements to non-listed companies with revenues of at least $100 million, with reporting to begin around FY2030.
Michael Tang, Head of the Sustainable Development Office, SGX RegCo, said:
“SGX-listed companies have been at the forefront of sustainability reporting. That Large Non-Listed Companies should start climate reporting will complement the progress of listed companies. As a whole, these efforts create a virtuous cycle of lifting standards all round and enabling Singapore corporates to make an outsize contribution towards global sustainability.”
The committee recommended that companies’ reporting mirror the requirements in the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) standards, with additional reliefs on complex disclosures such as additional time to implement Scope 3 emissions reporting. The ISSB released the finalized versions of its new sustainability and climate-related reporting standards earlier this week.
The recommendations also propose requiring external assurance on Scope 1 and 2 GHG reporting, beginning in FY2027 for listed issuers and FY2029 for large private companies.
SRAC Chairperson Esther An said:
“With more countries pledging for net zero and the rising carbon cost globally, climate strategy and reporting can help companies, listed or non-listed, to mitigate and adapt to risks in the transition to a low carbon economy. What gets measured gets managed. There is a strong business case for climate reporting as it has helped many businesses to improve performance and create stronger competitive advantage by capturing growth opportunities.”

"July 10, 2023","Investors, Banks Push Back on EU Plan to Ease Sustainability Reporting Rules","A coalition of investment and sustainable investing groups – including Eurosif, PRI, IIGCC, EFAMA, UNEP FI – alongside more than 90 asset managers announced the publication of a joint statement calling on the European Commission to reconsider its recent proposed changes to the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), which would ease several aspects of the EU’s upcoming Corporate Sustainable Reporting Directive (CSRD).
According to the statement, the changes would impact investors’ ability to obtain sustainability-related information required for investment decisions, in addition to reducing their ability to meet their own reporting requirements including those under the EU’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).
The statement said:
“The proposed approach would limit investor access to the consistent, comparable and reliable information needed to inform decisions and allocate capital in line with sustainability goals, including those of the European Green Deal, the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 and the EU Climate Law.”
Banking association AFME’s response, detailed below, raised similar concerns.
The CSRD, on track to begin applying from the beginning of 2024, is aimed as a major update to the 2014 Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), the current EU sustainability reporting framework. The new rules will significantly expand the number of companies required to provide sustainability disclosures to over 50,000 from around 12,000 currently, and introduce more detailed reporting requirements on company impacts on the environment, human rights and social standards and sustainability-related risk.
The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) was mandated by the European Commission in June 2020 to prepare for new EU sustainability reporting standards, and in November 2022, EFRAG submitted its final ESRS draft.
Following EFRAG’s submission, the EU Commission held consultations with regulators and member state sustainable finance groups, which the Commission said raised some concerns about the “challenging nature” of some of the reporting requirements. In June 2023, the EU Commission released a series of proposed changes to the ESRS, easing several of the reporting requirements. One of the key changes was a proposal for all disclosure requirements, with the exception of a set of general disclosures, to be subject to materiality assessments, effectively allowing companies to focus reporting on sustainability factors that they consider material to their businesses.
One of the investor statement’s key concerns is that the draft proposals, however, also allows voluntary disclosure by companies about why specific topics were deemed to be material or not.
Ultimately, the statement said, it would be up to corporates, supported by their consultants and advisers, to determine what is, and isn’t, material to report.
Specific items called for in the statement included maintaining key climate disclosures, including Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions, and transition plans mandatory, ensuring mandatory reporting for items relevant to investor regulatory requirements such as SFDR reporting, requiring explanations for why sustainability topics are deemed not material, and reconsidering the optional nature of disclosures regarding own workforce for non-employees and biodiversity transition plans. The investors also call on the EU to ensure the highest possible interoperability with the ISSB and GRI standards.
Eurosif Executive Director Aleksandra Palinska said:
“The first set of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, as published by the European Commission on 9 June, fails to address investors’ needs and risks undermining the effective implementation of the EU sustainable finance regulatory framework. The European Commission is now presented with a final opportunity to correct its course and find a compromise that would truly reflect all industry and stakeholders’ needs and better match the ambition of EU climate neutrality targets and the EU Green Deal.”
In its own response to the proposals on Thursday, European and global banking group the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) expressed similar concerns, particularly regarding the effect the changes to the ESRS rules on banks’ ability to meet their own sustainability-related reporting requirements.
In its response, AFME said:
“Under the revised draft ESRS, an undertaking can decide to omit such datapoints if it assesses the information to not be material. When omitted, such information is implicitly reported as “not material for the undertaking” and there is no obligation for the undertakings to explain why a topic was considered not material.
“These datapoints, however, are mandatory for financial institutions’ own disclosures and must be included in Pillar 3 and SFDR reporting even if the companies they finance deemed this information not material.”
AFME’s letter called on the Commission and regulators to provide a solution to help them meet their own reporting obligations in cases where companies have been able to omit relevant information, and for other clarifications in other areas where the proposed rules appear to conflict with their ability to gather information needed for disclosure, in addition to also appealing for strong interoperability with the ISSB standards.
AFME Managing Director, Sustainable Finance, Oliver Moullin, said:
“To ensure that financial institutions can effectively comply with their reporting requirements, it is essential that the Commission provides a solution to enable them to report effectively where relevant metrics have been omitted by their counterparties due to not being assessed as material.”",ESG REPORTING/ GOVERNMENT/ INVESTORS/ SUSTAINABLE FINANCE,ESGTODAY
"July 7, 2023",International Agreement Reached to Cut Shipping Emissions to Net Zero “Around” 2050,"The International Maritime Organization (IMO), the 175 member state UN agency responsible for developing global standards for shipping, announced today the adoption of “the 2023 IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships,” including new goals to reach net zero emissions from international shipping “by or around” 2050, and to ensure the uptake of low GHG emission fuels by 2030.
Maritime shipping accounts for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and are on track to roughly double by 2050 under most economic scenarios. Shipping emissions are also among the most difficult to address, with a need to develop and implement low emissions fuels, infrastructure and technologies in order to significantly reduce the sector’s climate footprint.
The new agreement marks a significant increase over the IMO’s prior 2050 goal of a 50% emissions reduction from shipping.
IMO Secretary-General Kitack Lim said:
“The adoption of the 2023 IMO Greenhouse Gas Strategy is a monumental development for IMO and opens a new chapter towards maritime decarbonization. At the same time, it is not the end goal, it is in many ways a starting point for the work that needs to intensify even more over the years and decades ahead of us. However, with the Revised Strategy that you have now agreed on, we have a clear direction, a common vision, and ambitious targets to guide us to deliver what the world expects from us.”
In addition to the net zero goal, the new strategy included a series of interim targets, including a 20% reduction, “striving for 30%,” by 2030, and a 70% reduction, “striving for 80%,” by 2040, on a 2008 basis. The strategy also set an ambition for at least 5%, “striving for 10%” of the energy used by international shipping to be zero or near-zero GHG emissions technologies, fuels or energy sources.
The new strategy also included plans to develop a series of measures aimed at delivering the new emissions reduction targets, including a marine fuel standard to regulate the phased reduction of marine fuel GHG intensity, and an emissions pricing mechanism.
While welcoming the sector’s increased ambition, environmental groups criticized the new IMO strategy as not being strong enough to support global climate goals.
Mark Lutes, Senior Global Climate Policy Advisor at WWF International, and head of the WWF delegation at the IMO, said:
“Disappointingly, the shipping industry regulator has left the sector with targets and measures off course for emissions reductions at the scale and pace needed. But voluntary actions, along with ambitious mandatory measures to be agreed by the IMO over the next 2 years, can help close the gap.  Shipping firms must now take the initiative and adopt science-based targets that put them on track for zero-emission shipping by 2050.”",ENVIRONMENT/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY

"July 6, 2023",PUMA Commits to Deforestation-Free Leather by 2030,"Athletic footwear, apparel, and accessories company PUMA announced today a new commitment to source all bovine leather from verified deforestation-free supply chains.
A recent report released by the UN-backed Race to Zero found that deforestation attributable to companies with land-based value chains, particularly in the forest, land and agriculture sectors, is responsible for a significant proportion of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The sectors contribute 22% of global emissions, half of which are driven by deforestation.
Earlier this year, the European Parliament passed a new law mandating companies to guarantee that their products sold in the EU do not contribute to deforestation and forest degradation in their supply chains.
The new commitment was announced with the company signing up to the Deforestation-Free Call to Action for Leather, an initiative by Textile Exchange and Leather Working Group, which aims to create equitable, transparent, and deforestation-free leather supply chains, while protecting wildlife, biodiversity, carbon stocks, and human rights.
The initiative asks brands to commit to sourcing their bovine leather from deforestation/conversion-free supply chains by 2030 or earlier, and set requirements for participating brands including working with farmers and farming supply chains to set requirements for deforestation-free sourcing, setting and meeting targets for mapping supply chains and identifying risk levels, making investments to increase the supply of traceable, deforestation and conversion-free leather, implement a traceability system, commit to respecting human rights across the supply chain, and reporting on progress.
PUMA highlighted one of its key challenges to ensuring deforestation-free sourcing, with suede representing half of the leather used by the company. The company said that suede presents traceability challenges at the cattle ranch level, with most suede tanneries working with agents and intermediaries besides direct tanneries to guarantee a stable supply.
Veronique Rochet, Senior Head of Sustainability, PUMA, said:
“This deforestation-free commitment also directly supports one of PUMA’s 10FOR25 sustainability targets dedicated to reducing our impact on biodiversity. To help the protection of endangered forests and species, PUMA also commits to not using any wood or wood-derived fabrics made from ancient and endangered forests.”",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT,ESGTODAY

"July 6, 2023",Up to $4 Trillion Investment Needed in Materials Supply Chains to Meet Decarbonization Goals: McKinsey,"As much as $4 trillion in investments may be needed by 2030 to scale up the materials supply chain to address upcoming supply shortages of key metals and materials required to meet global decarbonization goals, according to a new report released by global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.
The report, “The net-zero materials transition: Implications for global supply chains,” highlights the role of the materials supply chain as a key enabler of the global transition to net zero, with many of the technologies, from renewable energy and battery storage to electric vehicles, requiring more and different materials than the conventional technologies they are replacing.
On a per-GW basis, for example, solar PV’s material intensity is 1.4x that of conventional technology, according to the report, while onshore wind is 2.4x as material intensive, and offshore wind 6.3x. Similarly, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) can be 20% heavier, or more materials intensive, than comparable internal-combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.
As these technologies are increasingly deployed to help support initiatives to decarbonize industries, transportation, energy production and other sectors, the McKinsey report predicts that future growth rates for many materials are expected to outpace historical patterns, leading to shortages for many critical materials under a variety of scenarios examined by the study.
Forecast supply-demand imbalances include moderate shortages for battery materials including lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese and graphite, with more severe shortages for magnet materials, which are used in electric motors and wind turbine drivetrains, including by as much as 70% for dysprosium. Significant shortages are also forecast for key materials for end markets including semiconductors, electrolyzers, and process material.
The McKinsey report also highlights high local materials concentrations, such as rare earth elements in China and nickel in Indonesia, as potentially having an impact on regional access to materials.
In order to scale up the required supplies of these key materials and minerals, the report predicts that investments in the materials supply chain, including in mining, refining and smelting, will need to increase by $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030, including capital expenditure for exploration, and new and ongoing projects.
In addition to these investments, the report estimates that labor capacity will need to be increased by as much as 600,000 specialized mining professionals, and an additional energy supply of 200 GW – 500 GW will need to come online as well.
In addition to the need to ramp investments in the material supply chain, workforce and energy, the report outlines a series of recommended actions to help bridge the materials gap, including recommendations to drive a shift in demand patterns towards proven technologies that are less material-intensive or rely on less constrained materials, increase investment in materials innovation and recycling practices, and policy recommendations such as streamlining permitting processes and driving demand to alternative technologies.
Michel Van Hoey, senior partner at McKinsey & Company said:
“Increasingly bold climate targets are changing global material value chains, to the extent that the transition to net-zero emissions has sparked a materials transition. Our report provides an integrated perspective on those changes and key actions that will be required to balance the equation and safeguard the industry.”

As companies who are reliant on shipping work to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, it is essential that we dramatically expand the availability of these fuels.”
According to WasteFuel, the investment will be used to expand its network of low-carbon bio-methanol facilities, starting with a new facility in Dubai, with the aim of providing sustainable bio-methanol to leading global transportation companies.
The collaboration also includes a memorandum of understanding for bp to offtake WasteFuel’s bio-methanol and collaboration (using bp’s proprietary technology) to work on optimizing and enhancing the production of WasteFuel’s low-carbon bio-methanol.
With maritime transport responsible for 90% of global trade and 3% of greenhouse gas emissions, major shipping companies are converting to bio-methanol-ready ships, and utilizing bio-methanol can cut maritime emissions by a substantial amount in the coming years. Global shipping company Maersk, for example, recently announced a series of orders for ships capable of running on low-carbon methanol
The International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) is expected to finalize net-zero emission targets for the shipping sector, with a likely goal of achieving net-zero by 2050.
Gareth Burns, VP, bp ventures, said:
“WasteFuel projects will look to help with the growing volumes of global waste, whilst advancing the development of lower carbon solutions for hard-to-abate sectors. Achieving decarbonization in shipping will require a step-change, and biofuels have a key role to play in helping the industry to decarbonize. We look forward to working together on WasteFuel’s next stage of growth and market development.”
Philipp Schoelzel, VP of next generation biofuels, bp, added:
“Working with WasteFuel allows bp to offtake bio-methanol and help optimize production which could support decarbonizing shipping. bp is in action to produce more biofuels, aiming to deliver around 100,000 barrels per day by 2030, to help decarbonize transport. Investments like this are important as we strive to reach net zero and help our customers decarbonize too.”",COMPANIES/ ENERGY TRANSITION,ESGTODAY
"July 6, 2023",Biden Announces $1 Billion Investment in Clean Hydrogen “Demand-Side” Initiative,"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced today plans to invest $1 billion in a clean hydrogen demand side initiative, aimed at helping the development of Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs (H2Hubs) and mitigating the risk of investment for clean hydrogen development projects.
The announcement follows the release by the Biden Administration last month of its new U.S. National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap, aimed at significantly ramping the production, use and distribution of low carbon hydrogen for use in energy intensive industries and supporting U.S. decarbonization goals.
Hydrogen is viewed as one of the key building blocks of the transition to a cleaner energy future, particularly for sectors with difficult to abate emissions, in which renewable energy solutions such as wind or solar are less practical.
The development of clean hydrogen capacity, such as green hydrogen, which uses renewable energy to power the process to extract hydrogen from other materials, will require massive investments in areas including infrastructure, electrolysis, transport and storage.
The Biden administration has set clean hydrogen as a significant component of its climate strategy, and one of its key initiatives is the development of clean hydrogen hubs, or regional networks of infrastructure-connected producers and consumers of clean hydrogen, allocating $8 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for this project.
According to the DOE, the program announced today will help ensure that H2Hubs producers and users have the required market certainty in the early years of production to enable private investment. The initiative will help provide revenue certainty through mechanisms that could include pay-for-delivery contracts, offtake backstops, and feasibility funding to support analysis by offtakers, among others. The DOE has opened a request for information to gather feedback on the most effective measures to employ under the new initiative.
U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm said:
“Ensuring America is the global leader in the next generation of clean energy technologies requires all of us — government and industry — coming together to confront shared challenges, particularly lack of market certainty for clean hydrogen that too often delays progress. That’s why DOE is setting up a new initiative to help our private sector partners address bottlenecks and other project impediments — helping industry unlock the full potential of this incredibly versatile energy resource and supporting the long-term success of the H2hubs.”",ENERGY TRANSITION/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY
"July 5, 2023",EU Sets Sites on Fast Fashion with New Rules Making Producers Pay for Textile Waste,"The European Commission unveiled new proposed rules today aimed at supporting the sustainable management of textile waste, and placing responsibility for the full lifecycle of textile products in the hands of producers.
According to the EU Commission, consumption of textiles has the fourth highest impact on climate change and the environment, after food, housing and mobility, and is one of the top factors impacting water and land use as well as greenhouse gas emissions.
The EU generates 12.6 million tonnes of textile waste per year, including 5.2 million tonnes of clothing and footwear, while only 22% of post-consumer textile waste is collected separately for re-use or recycling, with the remainder often landfilled or incinerated.
Frans Timmermans, Executive Vice-President for the European Green Deal, said:
“The wasteful relationship we have developed with textiles pollutes our world. It uses excessive amounts of water and energy, harms nature, and drives greenhouse gas emissions across the globe. That’s why we will require producers to take stronger responsibility for the textile waste created.”
The EU Commission’s new proposal includes introducing mandatory Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes, similar to those that have been used to manage waste from packaging, batteries and electric and electronic equipment. Under the EPR schemes, producers would be required to cover the costs of management of textile waste, with the amount paid into the scheme adjusted based on the textiles’ environmental performance.
The Commission said that the scheme will incentivize waste reduction and increased textile circularity, with producers motivated to design better products from the start.
Producer payments under the proposals would be used to finance investments into separate collection, sorting, re-use and recycling capacities, with the Commission adding that the proposal will also promote R&D into circularity technologies for the textiles sector, such as fibre-to-fibre recycling.
The new rules follow the introduction by the EU Commission in March 2022 of the EU Strategy for Sustainable and Circular Textiles, aimed at addressing the lifecycle of textile products, and including proposals to change how textiles are produced and consumed. Stated objectives of the EU strategy include having all textile products placed on the EU market be durable, repairable and recyclable, and to “make fast fashion out of fashion.”
The proposal also includes rules aimed at addressing the illegal export of textile waste to other countries, ensuring that shipment will only take place with guarantees in place that the waste will be managed in an environmentally sound manner.
Virginijus Sinkevičius, Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, said:
“This initiative will drive investments in the re-use and recycling infrastructure for textiles, create local jobs and boost innovation in all phases of textiles’ lifecycle. It will also create cost-saving opportunities for citizens who choose vintage, timeless fashion over fast fashion.”",ENVIRONMENT/ GOVERNMENT,ESGTODAY
"July 5, 2023",Aeroporti di Roma Issues €400 Million Bond Tied to Climate Goals,"Aeroporti di Roma (ADR), the manager and developer of Rome Fiumicino and Ciampino airports, announced the completion of a new 10-year €400 million sustainability-linked bond (SLB), with the cost of debt on the bond tied to a series of the airport operations group’s climate-related goals.
This offering follows ADR’s issuance of the world’s first SLB by an airport operator in 2021 and its inaugural Green Bond in 2020. With the new issuance, the group’s sustainable debt share now exceeds 60%.
ADR published an updated Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework in 2022, outlining the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Sustainability Performance Targets (SPTs) to be used in sustainability-linked issuances, and trigger events that cause a step-up in debt cost.
Bonds issued under the new issuance will see a step-up in interest rate based on the achievement of three SPTs, including reducing absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 100% by 2030 from a 2019 baseline, maintaining the Airport Carbon Accreditation Level 4+ when reviewed in 2030, and reducing per-passenger Scope 3 emissions (excluding from aircraft sources by 30% by 2030, compared to 2019.
The coupon step-up is 20 bp per annum if one SPT is not met, 30 bp for two SPTs, and 40 bp if all three are missed, for a maximum cumulated step-up of 120 bp over the three interest periods.
According to ADR, demand for the offering was strong, and generated significant international interest, particularly from specialized ‘ESG’ investment operators. The offering was nearly 5x oversubscribed, drawing €1.9 billion of orders, with 95% of those coming from foreign investors.
Marco Troncone, Aeroporti di Roma CEO, said:
“This new issue reaffirms the consistency between Aeroporti di Roma’s commitment to sustainable development and its sustainable financing strategy. The SLB reinforces the credibility and transparency of the sector’s environmental transition plans, and will also be a guideline in support of our medium-long term development plan, to best combine environmental and social sustainability requirements with strengthening the competitiveness of a strategic sector for the country.”
Sustainability-linked debt is one of the fastest growing areas of sustainable finance, with attributes including interest payments tied to an issuer’s achievement of specific sustainability targets. Corporate interest in sustainability-linked loans has grown rapidly, as the financing provides flexibility to use proceeds for general corporate purposes, while with instruments such as green bonds, raised funds can only be allocated to specific categories of green projects.
Following an extended period of rapid growth, however, SLB issuance slowed sharply in late 2022, with Moody’s Investors Service citing factors such as growing market scrutiny on the credibility and robustness of issuers’ SLB targets, and the sector’s exposure to high-yield issuance.",COMPANIES/ SUSTAINABLE FINANCE,ESGTODAY
"July 5, 2023",Guest Post: The Biggest ESG Concern for Boards Isn’t What You Might Think,"By: Amanda Carty, Managing Director of ESG & Data Intelligence at Diligent
The concept of ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) has been in choppy waters this year with political resistance against ethical investing, as well as criticism of ESG as being virtue-signalling or supposedly distracting from financial returns. This begs the question, how are boards currently thinking about ESG?
The answer varies around the world, according to a survey of nearly 1,000 corporate directors globally conducted by Diligent Institute, the governance research arm of Diligent, and Spencer Stuart. In Europe, for example, where the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) has already begun its rollout, 56% of directors say they view ESG as an opportunity for their business, and 34% say ESG metrics have led to better performance of their stock. Meanwhile in the U.S., where there is still more uncertainty around local regulations and reporting frameworks, more directors are likely to view ESG as a risk (34%) than an opportunity (30%).
Regulations are a driving factor behind prioritizing disclosures
Whether ESG is viewed as a risk or opportunity, most boards recognize the value in collecting and measuring climate data, and organizations are mobilizing to prepare for regulatory reporting.
In the U.S., the SEC’s new climate disclosure rules are soon to come into play. Corporate directors are already preparing, with 55% saying they’ll take extra care to ensure their ESG strategies are adequately reflected in annual reports and filings. At the same time, 46% of directors plan to enhance their ESG disclosure methods. In Europe, where CSRD is already in play, directors not taking action on ESG are few and far between, with only 2% saying they aren’t prioritizing ESG strategies; as many as 14% of U.S. corporate directors say the same. 
Yet, directors still struggle to link ESG to broader business strategy
Despite variances in how corporate boards are thinking about ESG, directors around the world have one thing in common — nearly half want more clarity on how sustainability goals link to their larger corporate strategy.
Even as ESG is on the upswing, many directors still struggle to grasp what ESG looks like in practice. Lack clarity around what ESG means for the company, as well as trying to balance  ESG initiatives with competing business priorities or strategic interests, is where the greatest challenges lie for boards. In contrast, only 2% identified public backlash against ESG as being one of the greatest challenges.
The SEC’s new disclosure rules may provide some guidance. Boards and leadership roles will have to be re-focused to include ESG oversight. But to do that, boards need more visibility into progress on environmental goals, how environmental goals link to their broader business strategy and measure against competing risks and business objectives.
3 ways directors can overcome these challenges
1. Technology
To achieve and measure the new sustainability benchmarks, many boards will need improved technology. Organizations should invest in software that can track their carbon emissions and collect and organize information from across their value chain in a single database.
Technology can also help organizations: 
Adopt GHG accounting best practices, including keeping digital records of scope 1 and 2 emissions.
Start measuring scope 3 emissions.
Check for overlap with relevant frameworks.
Maintain dashboards of key GHG accounting and sustainability KPIs.
Ensure reports are in an audit-ready format.
2. Standardized and auditable reporting
In the past 20 years alone, supply chains have ballooned. Subsidiaries, suppliers, and third parties have created a complex network that can easily lead to gaps in oversight. The SEC’s new rules will only add to the complexity and volume of reporting requirements and board agendas. But that doesn’t mean directors’ workloads should increase, too. 
Organizations need to prioritize credible and defensible reporting. This requires intuitive data, well-curated dashboards, and best-in-class ESG technology. With these functions in place, directors should not only be able to automatically create reports that both offer actionable insights and hold up to future audits, but create engaging presentations backed by the latest data that tells a compelling story to their boards.
3. Skills and education
The proposed rules put ESG oversight squarely on the board and other leadership roles. To effectively champion ESG initiatives, directors need proactive education and skills training that equips them to intentionally and efficiently discuss climate and sustainability with management.
It’s likely that the SEC will hold boards accountable for overseeing sustainable growth strategies. New training and certifications must prioritize climate risk and ESG fundamentals, empowering directors to link business success to ongoing ESG efforts. 
Start standardized and streamlined ESG reporting
ESG reporting isn’t going away. If anything, the SEC disclosure rules signal a continued focus on transparency and accountability with respect to organizations’ ESG impact. 
But having a standardized and streamlined reporting system makes it possible to both answer to the continued emphasis on sustainability and prevent ESG fatigue. There will also likely need to be modifications and improvements to the SEC disclosure rules to break down barriers to adoption, but organizations can take action, too. 
Prioritizing skill enhancements, offering certifications, and leveraging carbon accounting technology now will help your corporate directors work smarter, not harder, no matter how the conversation around ESG evolves.

"July 5, 2023",NextEnergy Raises $480 Million for Solar Infrastructure Fund,"Solar developer NextEnergy Group’s investment management arm NextEnergy Capital (NEC) announced that it has raised $480 million at the first close of NextPower V ESG (NPV ESG), its flagship OECD-focused solar strategy.
The firm said that it is targeting $1.5 billion in capital commitments for the fund, with a hard cap of $2 billion.
NPV ESG is a closed-ended investment vehicle that focuses on solar PV and energy storage infrastructure projects in OECD countries which, aimed at providing investors with attractive risk-adjusted returns while contributing to decarbonization efforts, reducing electricity prices, and enhancing energy security.
According to NEC, investments from the Article 9 fund are forecast to produce enough clean energy to power the equivalent of up to 750,000 households per year, avoiding the equivalent of consuming  up to 150 million cubic metres of natural gas per year.
The company said that it has identified a pipeline of investment opportunities for the strategy spanning over 14GW in the fund’s primary geographies including Europe, North America, and Chile.
Michael Bonte-Friedheim, CEO and Founding Partner of NextEnergy Group, said:
“NPV ESG’s first close represents an important milestone as the fund secures strong investor support from the get-go.  Utility-scale solar represents a very large investment opportunity set globally, with total spending in 2023 forecast to reach $382bn, and we aim to continue our leadership role in the sector.”
Investors in this close include Norwegian pension company KLP, a German occupational pension fund, and a prominent Nordic pension fund. The fund is expected to attract more investors during its second funding round later this year, with several currently engaged in due diligence.
Shane Swords, NextEnergy Capital Managing Director and Head of Investor Relations, said:
“I think this fund creates a fantastic opportunity for investors looking for strong and stable renewable energy returns. This first close sends a strong signal to the market that, despite the current environment, investors continue to seek a specialist investment manager with a successful track record of delivery, deployment and superior return generation.”",ENERGY TRANSITION/ PRIVATE EQUITY,ESGTODAY
"July 5, 2023",Code of Conduct for ESG Data and Ratings Providers Launched as Regulatory Pressure Builds,"The ESG Data and Ratings Working Group (DRWG), an industry group formed at the request of UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), announced today the launch of a draft voluntary Code of Conduct for ESG ratings and data providers. The DRWG has also established a consultation into the draft Code, which will remain open until October 5, 2023.
Key aims of the code include improving the availability and quality of information for investors at both the product and entity level, improving transparency, governance and systems and controls in order to enhance market integrity, and fostering better comparability of products and providers in order to improve competition in the ESG data and ratings space.
The new code of conduct comes as pressure builds to regulate providers of ESG ratings and data, with demand for the services surging as investors increasingly integrate ESG considerations into the investment process, while the activities and businesses of the providers are generally not covered by markets and securities regulators.
In June, for example, the EU Commission unveiled a proposal for ESG ratings providers to be supervised by European markets regulator ESMA, to ensure quality and reliability, with requirements including the use of rigorous and objective methodologies, conflict of interest prevention, and improved transparency into methodologies, models and key rating assumptions.
In November 2021, securities regulator standards setter IOSCO urged regulators to focus on improving transparency in the ESG ratings and data space, and to begin to apply regulatory oversight. IOSCO also provided a series of recommendations for regulators, such as requiring providers to identify and disclose potential conflicts of interest, and to consider the data and methodologies used by the providers.
The FCA announced the formation of the DRWG in November 2022, tasked with developing a code of conduct for ESG data and ratings providers, taking into account the IOSCO recommendations, as well as developments in other jurisdictions, in order for it to be internationally consistent, and to help encourage the development of consistent global standards.
Sacha Sadan, FCA Director of ESG, said:
“Today is an important step in increasing transparency and trust in the growing market for ESG data and ratings products. It’s also vital that the Code has been developed with international consistency in mind.”
The proposed code of conduct is built around six key principles, including Good Governance, ensuring that ESG ratings and data products providers have appropriate governance and oversight arrangements in place; Securing Quality, requiring providers to adopt and implement written policies and procedures to ensure high quality ESG ratings and data products; Conflicts of Interest; Transparency, covering the methodologies and processes that underpin ESG ratings and data products; Confidentiality, for management and protection of non-public information, and; Engagement, including providing covered entities with visibility into what to expect from the assessment process.
The FCA appointed the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) and the International Regulatory Strategy Group (IRSG) as the Secretariat for the group. The DRWG is co-chaired by M&G, Moody’s, London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) and Slaughter and May, and also includes investors, ESG data and ratings providers, and rated entities.
The Steering Committee of the DRWG said:
“Members of the DRWG have worked hard to make sure the Code of Conduct is internationally consistent, primarily through close alignment with the International Organization of Securities Commissions’ recommendations but also through taking into account developments in jurisdictions such as Japan, Singapore and the EU. We hope the Code of Conduct will be a significant step in the development of consistent global standards for ESG ratings and data product providers.”

"July 5, 2023",60% of Analysts say Companies’ ESG Claims not Backed up by Action: Fidelity Survey,"Approximately 60% of analysts estimated that the ESG credentials promoted by the companies that they cover are not backed up by their actions, although companies are becoming more responsive on ESG issues, as companies increasingly tie sustainability factors to remuneration and assign board-level oversight to ESG, according to a new survey by investment manager Fidelity International.
For the study, the “2023 Fidelity International ESG Analyst Survey,” Fidelity surveyed 123 of its in-house analyst from across the firm’s Equities, Fixed Income, Private Credit, and Sustainable Investing teams, aggregating bottom-up information from approximately 15,000 company interactions.
The survey indicated that while companies do appear to be increasingly embedding ESG considerations in their activities and plans, many are not yet on track to hit their sustainability goals and more appear to be overstating ESG claims relative to their actions.
While most developed-world multinationals have now committed to net zero targets, for example, fewer than 60% are on track to cut emissions to net zero by 2050, according to the survey, which  found that only 57% are currently spending enough to hit net zero by 2050, with European companies in the lead at 69%, and North American companies at 53%.
Analysts’ estimates of companies that will succeed in achieving net zero by 2030 have declined slightly since last year, with the analysts now forecasting 24% of their companies will hit this goal, compared to 25% last year, with sharper declines in Europe (25% this year vs 31% last year) and Japan (27% this year vs 31% last year), while North America improved to 23% from 20% and China to 29% from 23%.
The decline comes as companies face stresses caused by weak global economic conditions, placing pressure on them to focus on more immediate results instead of longer-term sustainability issues.
Fidelity International China property sector analyst Ming Gong said:
“Most of my companies are either in default or deeply stressed. ESG has been low on their priorities and will very likely remain so in the next 12 months.”
One of the key factors holding back progress and investment towards hitting companies’ climate goals is a gap in technology. Mining and commodities analyst Laura Stafford said:
“In many cases the technology is not yet there. For those targeting net zero by 2050 they still don’t have a clear roadmap of how to get there so it’s impossible to say how much capital will even be needed.”
While companies appear to not yet be on track to hit their climate goals, the survey did find more of a focus on ESG at many companies, with 73% of analysts saying that their companies are responsive on ESG issues, more than 50% reporting that management remuneration is now linked to emission targets, and more than 60% of companies now having board-level oversight of sustainability.
Despite this, however, the survey indicated that more companies may be overstating their ESG claims, with nearly 60% of analysts responding that their companies promote either “moderately” or “significantly” better ESG credentials than their actions justify. This finding was particularly pronounced in the Energy sector, where only 17% said that their companies’ actions at least match efforts to promote ESG credentials.
Jenn-Hui Tan, Global Head of Stewardship and Sustainable Investing at Fidelity International, said:
“Our ESG Analyst Survey asks whether companies’ net zero plans are sufficient. The answer is: not yet and a greater collective effort is needed. Further funding, technological innovation and regulation are just some of the areas identified if we are to close the gap between ambition and reality. But corporates cannot do it alone. Governments, like policy decision makers have a key role to play in creating an enabling environment for the transition, as does the financial sector through investor engagement, shareholder action and asset allocation.”","COMPANIES/ REPORTS, STUDIES",ESGTODAY
"July 4, 2023",ZF Signs €1.5 Billion Low Carbon Steel Purchase Agreement with H2 Green Steel,"Swedish startup H2 Green Steel announced today that it has signed a 7-year binding agreement with global auto supplier ZF for delivery of near-zero emissions steel, valued at €1.5 billion.
Founded in 2020, H2 Green Steel is building the world’s first large-scale fossil-free steel plant in Boden, Sweden, with the project including a giga-scale green hydrogen plant as an integrated part of the steel production facility. The company employs hydrogen produced using green power to remove the oxygen from iron oxide, avoiding most of the CO2 emissions normally produced, and uses electricity from 100% renewable sources for the energy requirements generated in the manufacturing process. H2 Green Steel aims to begin production in 2025, with plans to produce 5 million tons of nearly fossil-free steel by 2030.
The agreement follows recent deal announcements from H2 Green Steel with companies including Mercedes-Benz, Scania, and steel producer BILSTEIN.
Henrik Henriksson, CEO of H2 Green Steel, said:
“This is a true milestone contract for H2 Green Steel, not the least because of its size. ZF’s role in the automotive ecosystem is undeniable and they are a true partner to us where we also see potential to move into other regions, like North America.”
While the companies did not disclose the volume of steel to be delivered under the new agreement, H2 Green Steel said that the deal covers “a significant share” of ZF’s roughly 2.5 million tonnes of direct and indirect steel processed per year, and will result in CO2 emissions savings of 2.3 million tonnes compared to traditional steelmaking processes. Deliveries of the steel are expected to begin in 2026.
ZF has set goals to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 corporate carbon footprint by 80% and Scope 3 emissions intensity by 40% by 2030, and to achieve net zero across all scopes by 2040.
ZF Board of Management member Stephan von Schuckmann said:
“No one can fight climate change alone, but teaming up with partners, we can achieve a lot. H2 Green Steel is a good example of startups working together with established players to drive change faster than the incumbent industry has managed. For ZF, this is a strategic agreement in our significant efforts to reduce CO2 emissions from our supply chain.”",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT,ESGTODAY
"July 4, 2023","UK Tightens Emissions Caps for Aviation, Power Sectors Beginning 2024","The UK announced a series of reforms for its Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), including the introduction of tighter emissions limits for the aviation and power sectors and other energy intensive industries beginning in 2024.
The UK ETS Authority also announced that new sectors will be added to the ETS, including the domestic maritime transport sector from 2026, and the waste incineration and waste from energy sectors from 2028.
Launched in 2021 to replace the UK’s participation in the EU’s Emissions Trading System, the UK ETS sets a limit on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for key GHG intensive sectors, which decreases over time to motivate companies to lower emissions in line with sector climate goals, with companies obtaining allowances for every tonne of emissions the produce each year, and companies that are successful in reducing emissions below the cap limit able to sell emissions allowances on the secondary market to other industry participants.
The system also allocates free allowances to support businesses in sectors that face overseas competition in order to avoid carbon leakage, in which production or activity is moved to a location with lower or no emissions limits.
The new reforms follow a consultation last year by the UK ETS Authority on a tighter range of allowances determined to keep the system consistent with net zero, which was 30% – 35% below the current legislated cap. The authority said that it has elected to set the cap at the highest end of the range, in order to allow “maximum flexibility for industries.” Additionally, the authority announced that free allowances will be kept at current levels until 2026 “to give industries certainty over the level of support available in the medium term,” and that additional allowances will be released to the market between 2024 and 2027 to ensure a smooth transition to the new net zero-aligned cap.
The authority also announced a decision to phase out free allocations to the aviation industry in 2026, after determining that there is minimal risk of carbon leakage in the sector.
In addition to the tighter caps and allowance changes, the authority also announced a decision to incorporate Greenhouse Gas Removal (GGR) technologies such as Direct Air Capture (DAC) into the UK ETS, provided that they meet robust standards, in a move aimed at incentivizing investment in the technologies, and that it would may also include nature-based GHG removal solutions, subject to further consideration.
In a joint statement, UK ETS Authority Ministers, including Lord Callanan, Julie James MS, Màiri McAllan MSP and Gareth Davies MP said:
“Our UK Emissions Trading Scheme, along with other interventions, forms part of a wider strategy to provide a long-term framework to incentivise UK industries to decarbonise – seizing the huge opportunities that are arising from a rapidly expanding clean energy sector, and providing the certainty that industries need to invest in new green technologies.

"July 3, 2023",Estée Lauder Launches Responsible Store Design Framework,"Prestige beauty company Estée Lauder Companies (ELC) announced the launch of its new Responsible Store Design program, providing a framework for assessing new and existing stores across sustainability-related areas including waste reduction, water and energy conservation, and responsible material sourcing.
According to the company, the new program is aimed at supporting ELC’s progress towards its environmental commitments and engaging consumers in its “retail sustainability journey.” ELC has set a range of environmental sustainability goals, including targets to reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 50%  and Scope 3 emissions from categories including purchased goods and services, upstream transportation and distribution and business travel by 60%by 2030, transitioning its vehicle fleet to EVs by 2030, reaching 25% recycled material in packaging by 2025 and reducing the use of virgin petroleum plastic in its packaging to 50% or less by 2030, among others.
The company also finalized Green Building Standards in 2020 for new construction and major renovation for all company spaces, including its retail locations, setting a baseline for sustainability practices across energy, water, waste, and indoor air quality, and used for the new Responsible Store Design program.
Estée Lauder stated that the new program was developed with the assistance of a sustainability consulting firm, and reviewed for accuracy and credibility by a third party.
In order to participate in the program, brands must meet all of its prerequisites, which vary based on the retail space and store type. New store criteria include developing waste management plans for store build-out to reduce waste to landfill, installing energy- and water-efficient technologies and fixtures, responsibly sourcing store materials, and responsibly designing visual merchandising that is free of virgin acrylic materials. All freestanding stores also leverage renewable energy through ELC’s Virtual Power Purchasing Agreement (VPPA).
Existing store criteria include building out energy-efficient technologies to reduce energy use in store fixtures and visual merchandising, installing water-efficient plumbing fixtures to reduce water use, sourcing all store fixtures and materials in alignment with ELC’s Thoughtful Material standards, designing visual merchandising that is free of virgin acrylic materials, having recycling available for employees and customers, designing a cleaning program for the store using Ecolab-certified or equivalent products, alongside other energy reduction and responsible material criteria.
The program also includes visual merchandising prerequisites allowing store counters and displays in multi-channel retailers to participate in the program, including the use of energy efficient lighting, merchandising that is free of virgin acrylic, and other sustainable materials criteria, as well as end of life merchandising requirements including implementing a partnership to reclaim and recycle visual merchandising, designing visual merchandising with no integrated lighting and using only materials that are easily recycled in curbside systems, minimizing packaging to reduce waste, and designing visual merchandising without the use of any acrylic to improve recyclability.
Al Iannuzzi, Vice President, Sustainability at ELC, said:
“Sustainability has long been part of our corporate strategy and company culture, and our new Responsible Store Design program is a creative and impactful way to showcase ELC’s sustainability commitments to both our employees and our consumers. We’re excited to launch our branded retail sustainability program and look forward to scaling this work beyond our pilot stores to impact retail operations globally in the future.”",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT,ESGTODAY

"July 3, 2023",Salesforce Adds ESG Reporting Capabilities to Sustainability Platform,"CRM solutions provider Salesforce announced the launch of the SASB Report Builder within its Net Zero Cloud sustainability management solution, expanding the platform with capabilities enabling users to automate the disclosure of ESG data, in alignment with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards.
SASB was founded in 2011, with the mission to establish industry-specific ESG disclosure standards for companies.  The standards set by SASB are designed to enable investors to assess the materiality of reported sustainability information, and to compare companies on these metrics on a global basis. In 2021, SASB merged with the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC)  to launch the Value Reporting Foundation, which subsequently announced its own consolidation into the IFRS Foundation at the launch of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).
The launch of the new capabilities comes as companies globally are coming under increasing pressure to meet climate and ESG regulatory requirements, many of which include or reference the SASB standards. Last week, the IFRS’ ISSB officially launched its new global sustainability and climate disclosure standards, which will require industry-specific disclosure and require companies to consider the SASB standards to identify sustainability-related risks, opportunities and related metrics.
Regulators in major jurisdictions around the world including Europe, the UK and the U.S., among others, have introduced or are preparing mandatory sustainability reporting requirements for companies, and most will be heavily influenced by the ISSB standards.
Nicolai Lundy, IFRS Foundation’s Chief of Market Relationships, said:
“We are very pleased to see Salesforce’s use of SASB Standards in their new SASB Report Builder. By integrating industry-based standards into the Net Zero Cloud platform, SASB Report Builder can help companies monitor, manage, and report the sustainability-related risks and opportunities relevant to their industry. This can also help companies prepare for new ISSB Standards.”
Salesforce launched Net Zero Cloud in 2019 (as “Sustainability Cloud”) to provide users with a 360-degree view of their environmental impact with the ability to track, analyze and report reliable environmental data, and last year the company released Net Zero Cloud 2.0, which integrated solutions from across Salesforce’s portfolio to add supplier collaboration technology from Slack, and the use of CRM dashboards from Salesforce company Tableau to provide sustainability insights. In December 2022, Salesforce added social and governance data management capabilities to Net Zero Cloud with the launch of its Automate ESG Reporting solution.
With its new SASB Report Builder, the company is adding to the platform’s ESG reporting capabilities with the ability to generate ESG reports across 14 industries across sectors including consumer goods, financials, services, and technology & communications.
Ari Alexander, VP and GM, Salesforce Net Zero Cloud, said:
“Expanding Net Zero Cloud with the SASB Report Builder is a significant next step toward helping organizations automate and streamline their ESG reporting process. Moving forward, we see tremendous potential in the power of generative AI to drive further ESG reporting efficiencies and to add value for our customers — helping them save time and costs while improving the state of the world.”","ESG REPORTING/ ESG TOOLS, SERVICES",ESGTODAY
"July 3, 2023",Nestlé Moves Away from Carbon Offsets to Focus on Emissions Reductions Across Brands,"Global food and beverage company Nestlé will shift away from the use of offsets to achieve carbon neutral brands, focusing instead on actual emissions reductions in its operations and value chain, according to a company spokesperson, following media reports that the company was walking away from carbon neutral pledges for some brands.
In the statement, the Nestlé spokesperson said:
“We are moving away from investing in carbon offsets for our brands to invest in programs and practices that help reduce GHG emissions in our own supply-chain and operations, where it makes the most difference to reach our net zero ambition.”
Nestlé announced a commitment in 2019 to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, and in 2020 the company published its “time bound plan” to reach its climate goals, which also include targets to achieve a 20% emissions reduction by 2025 and 50% by 2030.
In addition to efforts targeting agricultural emissions and transitioning to 100% renewable electricity, the plan included a pledge to be “continuously increasing the number of ‘carbon neutral’ brands.”  The company’s Net Zero Roadmap explains that in order to achieve carbon neutrality at the product level, GHG emissions from all stages of the product’s life cycle would need to be reduced or removed “or, as a last resort, accounted for through a system of offsets resulting in a product that has a carbon footprint of zero.”
While the use of offsetting practices to account for emissions that are more challenging to eliminate forms part of most companies’ net zero plans, some companies’ climate pledges are coming under increasing scrutiny for relying too heavily on offsetting schemes rather than on actual emissions reductions. A recent study of high-emitting companies by climate-focused non-profits NewClimate Institute and Carbon Market Watch, for example, found that the companies plan to offset between 23% and 45% of their combined emission footprint, and that the amount of land-use related offsets included in corporate climate strategies would significantly outstrip the global availability of such assets.
95% of Nestlé’s GHG emissions come from the company’s value chain, including around two-thirds from sourcing ingredients, and only around 5% from its direct operations. One of the company’s key emissions reduction initiatives includes advancing regenerative agriculture and farming practices, such as improving soil health, integrating trees into livestock foraging areas, switching to organic fertilizers and increasing the ability of farmland to store carbon. The company has pledged to invest CHF 1.2 billion in regenerative agriculture initiatives across its supply chain by 2025, and to source 50% of its key ingredients through regenerative agriculture methods by 2030. The company is also pursuing initiatives to improve the sustainability of its packaging and logistics, the second and third most significant sources of its carbon footprint, respectively.
The spokesperson added:
“Our net zero roadmap does not rely on offsets. We focus on GHG emissions reductions and removals within our value chain to reach our net zero ambition.”",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT,ESGTODAY

"June 30, 2023","AXA Sets New Targets to Decarbonize Investment, Insurance Portfolios","Insurance group AXA announced today a series of decarbonization targets for its investment and insurance activities, including goals to reduce emissions of its largest commercial insurance clients by 30% and to cut the carbon footprint of the group’s general account investment assets by 50% by 2030, on a 2019 basis.
The new goals, published with the release of the company’s 2023 Climate & Biodiversity Report, come shortly after AXA’s decision alongside several other major insurers to exit the Net Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), amid anti-ESG political pressure in the U.S. At the time, AXA, who was a founding member and Chair of the NZIA, committed to continue using the toolsets developed in the alliance to pursue their individual decarbonization targets and support clients in their own climate transitions. The company remains a member of the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance.
The new report also includes for the first time decarbonization targets for various AXA Property & Casualty insurance portfolios, including a goal to reduce the carbon intensity of the most material personal motor portfolios by 20%. In addition to the 30% emissions reduction target for the largest clients, the company also announced a goal to reduce the carbon intensity of other corporate clients by 20% by 2030 compared with a 2021 baseline.
Axa also introduced goals to increase its business in the renewable energies sector and across sectors transitioning to low carbon business models, and to strengthen dialogue with corporate customers, external stakeholders and partners, to better support them in the transition.
In the report, AXA also revealed that the “implied temperature rise,” which measures the 2050 warming impact of the group’s general account portfolio’s bond and equities holdings decreased by 0.1°C compared to the previous year, and now stands at 2.5°C, compared to the market average of 2.7°C.

"June 30, 2023",UK Environment Minister Quits Over Government “Apathy” on Climate,"UK Foreign Office Minister for Overseas Territories, Commonwealth, Energy, Climate and Environment Zac Goldsmith announced his resignation from his post on Friday, with a sharp rebuke to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s “apathy” towards government efforts to tackle climate change and environmental issues that he said made his role “untenable.”
In his resignation letter, Goldsmith praised the UK’s leadership on environmental and climate initiatives over the past several years, highlighting in particular the UK-hosted COP26 climate conference in 2021, as well as its substantial influence on last year’s international agreement to protect 30% of global land and oceans by 2030 and on efforts to establish a global treaty on plastic pollution.
Under Sunak, however, Goldsmith said that he has “been horrified as, bit by bit, we have abandoned these commitments,” adding that the UK has visibly stepped off the world stage and withdrawn our leadership on climate and nature. Specific criticisms in the letter included the Prime Minister’s decision not to attend “a critically important environment summit in Paris” earlier this month, referring to the Summit for a New Financial Pact, and on effectively abandoning a “pledge to spend £11.6bn of our aid on climate and environment,” and that “the only reason the government has not had to come clean on the broken promise is because the final year of expenditure falls after the next general election and will therefore be the problem for the next government, not this one.”
Goldsmith specifically pointed to the Prime Minister as being responsible for the “government’s apathy,” writing:
“The problem is not that the government is hostile to the environment, it is that you, our prime minister, are simply uninterested. That signal, or lack of it, has trickled down through Whitehall and caused a kind of paralysis.”
Goldsmith’s resignation follows a rebuke on Thursday in a special report issued by the Privileges Committee as part of a group of MPs and peers who interfered with the Boris Johnson “Partygate” probe in the House of Commons.
It has been a privilege to have been able to make a difference to a cause I have been committed to for as long as I remember.

"June 29, 2023",FCA Flags Greenwashing Concerns in Sustainability-Linked Loan Market,"The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the UK conduct regulator for financial services firms and financial markets, announced today the publication of a letter to banks and companies, outlining a series of market integrity concerns related to the sustainability-linked loan (SLL) market that it said could hold back the development of a useful net zero transition financing tool and raise the risk of greenwashing.
Sustainability-linked debt is one of the fastest growing areas of sustainable finance, with attributes including interest payments tied to an issuer’s achievement of specific sustainability targets. Corporate interest in sustainability-linked loans has grown rapidly over the past several years, as the financing provides flexibility to use proceeds for general corporate purposes, while with instruments such as green bonds, raised funds can only be allocated to specific categories of green projects.
After an extended period of growth, the FCA noted the emergence of negative media coverage of the SLL market, with concerns about the robustness of market integrity, which the regulator added were corroborated with market intelligence gathered earlier this year.
In the letter, signed by FCA Director of ESG Sacha Sadan, the FCA wrote:
“A number of the issues identified have informed our observations about the possibility of potential risks to market integrity and suspicion of greenwashing in the context of SLLs.”
Integrity-related concerns included weak incentives in the sustainability-related terms of the loans, and low-ambition sustainability targets and indicators chosen for the loans.
In subsequent engagements with market stakeholders, the FCA also said that it also noted potential conflicts of interest, with banks in some cases providing remuneration incentives to promote SLLs in order to help achieve their sustainable finance targets, potentially leading them to accept weak Sustainable Performance Targets (SPTs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in the loan agreements.
Observations from the engagements included very small step-ups in interest costs for investment grade SLLs in which the issuer missed a performance target, “at around 2.5bps and capped at circa 5bps.” Additionally, the FCA pointed out a sentiment among banks that relationships, rather than a borrower’s sustainability credentials disproportionately drove banks’ decisions to participate in SLLs.
While the FCA noted that it does not directly regulate the SLL market, the regulator said that it will continue to monitor the market “with a view to considering the need for further measures to support the development of a robust transition finance ecosystem.”
The letter also highlighted the recently revised Loan Market Association’s Sustainability-Linked Loan Principles (SLLP) as a source to help address the concerns raised.
Sadan said:
“Sustainability-linked loans are important financing tools for the transition to a low carbon economy. However, there are some issues holding back more widespread adoption and market growth.
“We want to build trust and integrity in these products. We hope all market participants will consider carefully today’s findings as well as the existing principles published by the Loan Market Association.”",REGULATORS/ SUSTAINABLE FINANCE,ESGTODAY
"June 28, 2023",Brookfield Properties to Power Entire U.S. Office Portfolio with Zero Emissions Electricity,"Brookfield Properties announced today that its more than 70-million-square-foot U.S. office portfolio – one of the largest office portfolios in the U.S. – will be powered by zero emissions electricity by 2026, with more than 65% of its office space, including all New York and Washington, D.C. office properties transitioning to zero emissions electricity by 2024.
According to Brookfield, the transition will make the company the largest U.S. commercial real estate user of zero emissions electricity by a wide margin. The company added that it expects to achieve the equivalent of avoiding over 260,000 metric tons of CO2 annually by entering into contracts for approximately 600,000 MWh of electricity from zero emissions sources.
Buildings are a key source of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and also one of the hardest to replace, given their long-term nature. Brookfield said that it expects the transition to zero emissions electricity to reduce direct emissions from its U.S. office portfolio by around 80%, and enable office tenants to eliminate Scope 2 carbon emissions associated with their electricity consumption.
Brookfield outlined its plans for energy sourcing, with the company procuring 49% of the electricity for the portfolio from hydropower, 33% from solar and wind and 18% from nuclear, and with more than 85% of power coming from new plants enabled by the company’s commitment or bundled Purchase Power Agreements (PPAs) under which Brookfield directly buys electricity and receives Energy Attribute Certificates such as RECs or EFECs.
Ben Brown, Managing Partner at Brookfield Real Estate, said:
“Instead of taking incremental steps or waiting for others to act, we are completely transforming how we power office buildings throughout the United States. Not only will it significantly advance our goal of transitioning our entire portfolio to net zero carbon, but also we are confident that both the increased demand for zero emissions electricity it will create and the industry precedence it will set will be a game-changer for how state-of-the-art office buildings are powered throughout the country.”",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT,ESGTODAY
"June 28, 2023",New Rulebook for Company Carbon Market Claims Launched by VCMI,"Carbon markets-focused body the Voluntary Carbon Market Integrity Initiative (VCMI) announced today the launch of its Claims Code of Practice, aimed at providing a rulebook for companies to navigate carbon markets and make credible climate claims.
According to the VCMI, the new code aims to help build market confidence for companies’ engagement with voluntary carbon markets (VCMs), in order to accelerate corporate VCM use as part of their net zero pathways.
VCMI Steering Committee Co-Chair Rachel Kyte said:
“Voluntary carbon markets bring considerable benefits as part of companies’ net-zero transition and as a means of financing climate transition worldwide. Against a backdrop of recent criticism, we are now at a juncture where only consistent, well-considered global guidance can underpin a high-quality market and stimulate the rapid scaling of corporate use we need. The Claims Code will give greater confidence and develop trust in those who use it. If you build integrity, trust will follow, and trust is the foundation of a high value, high impact market.”
Demand for carbon offset projects that counteract the release of greenhouse gases, and related credits, is expected to increase significantly over the next several years, as companies and businesses increasingly launch net zero ambitions, and turn to offsets as a bridge to their own absolute emissions reduction efforts, or to balance difficult to avoid emissions.
Demand for carbon offset projects and related credits is expected to increase significantly over the next several years, as companies and businesses increasingly launch net zero ambitions, and turn to offsets as a bridge to their own absolute emissions reduction efforts, or to balance difficult to avoid emissions. The unregulated and rapidly growing market faces a series of challenges, however, with market participants unable to differentiate between high and low quality projects with insufficient or inconsistent data to assess the effectiveness of the projects.
Announced in 2021 by COP26 President Alok Sharma, VCMI collaborates with stakeholders across the private sector, indigenous peoples, local communities, and governments in order to enable high-integrity voluntary carbon markets that meaningfully contribute to climate action and support the achievement of the UN SDGs. The body’s initiatives include the demand-side focused Claims Code released today, and the supply side-focused VCM Access Strategy Toolkit, designed to help policymakers establish policies and processes to enable their countries’ participation in high-integrity VCMs.
The new claims code introduces three tiers of claims – Platinum, Gold and Silver – for investments in GHG emissions reductions and removals, and outlines the steps required to make a “VCMI Claim,” including meeting the VCMI’s Foundational Criteria for climate strategy, selecting a Platinum, Gold or Silver claim, selecting carbon markets which meet stringent quality thresholds in line with the Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Markets (IC-VCM) Core Carbon Principles (CCPs), and disclosing information to support the claim and conducting independent validation and assurance.
VCMI Steering Committee Co-Chair Tariye Gbadegesin said:
“Integrity is what will make the VCM a powerful tool that gets us to a net-zero world and mobilizes much-needed finance to low- and middle income-countries, faster. Clear and transparent guidance about the voluntary use of carbon credits has been missing. Now that the VCMI Claims Code is available to guide corporate claims made with the use of VCMs and eventually when paired with ICVCM’s Core Carbon Principles guiding supply, market participants have the key ingredients of what we call “end to end” integrity which will enable this crucial market development.”","ENVIRONMENT/ ESG TOOLS, SERVICES",ESGTODAY

AstraZeneca launched AZ Forest in 2020, with an initial pledge to plant and maintain more than 50 million trees by the end of 2025, in order to contribute to climate action, nature restoration and biodiversity promotion, in addition to building ecological and community resilience.
According to the company’s latest Sustainability Report, more than 10.5 million trees from over 300 species have been planted under the program as of the end of 2022, in countries including Australia, Indonesia, Ghana, the UK, the US and France, allowing the restoration of biodiversity and natural habitats.
With today’s announcement, AstraZeneca will expand and add new projects in countries including Brazil, India, Vietnam, Ghana and Rwanda, with the program spanning over 100,000 hectares worldwide, positively impacting an estimated 80,000 livelihoods, and removing approximately 30 million tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere.
In addition to planting, the program includes a commitment to ensure the long-term survival of the trees. The program includes the use of remote sensing, high-resolution imagery, and long-term monitoring to track factors including the health of trees, soil and water quality and biodiversity, as well as carbon sequestration. The company also said that it has partnered with the European Forest Institute (EFI) and the Circular Bioeconomy Alliance (CBA) to publish a science-based framework for sustainable, resilient and locally appropriate landscape regeneration.
According to AstraZeneca, the program forms part of its sustainability strategy, Ambition Zero Carbon, which includes goals for the company to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from operations and fleet by 98% by 2026, and achieve a 50% reduction in value chain emissions by 2030 and a 90% absolute reduction by 2045. The company aims to address its residual emissions through AZ Forest from 2030 onwards.
AstraZeneca was one of the first seven companies globally to have its climate targets certified under the Science Based Targets initiative’s Net Zero Standard in 2021.

We are taking a science-based approach, and AZ Forest will remove around 30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over about 30 years.”",COMPANIES/ ENVIRONMENT,ESGTODAY
"June 28, 2023",Guest Post: ISSB Standards Week – A Pivotal Moment to Tackle Some of Society’s Biggest Challenges,"By: John McCalla-Leacy, Head of Global ESG at KPMG
The news agenda is filled with discussions about the climate crisis and the business world’s response to ESG challenges. We hear leaders – from the political and business worlds – full of great intentions. However, transforming enthusiasm into impactful action is often the biggest blocker to much needed change.
In Late 2021 the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) was set up to enable the move towards aligned global action on what companies report. This week, after a period of in-depth planning, meetings and negotiations, it’s publishing its global standards – effectively a framework for companies throughout the planet to explain clearly and consistently the effects that ESG matters have on their business now and into the future – and what they are doing to manage those effects.
Attempting to create a consistent international approach for business leaders is nothing new – but there is a real sense that the ISSB’s actions could finally result in a transformation of how the business world consistently and transparently communicates and is judged on its actions.
As KPMG’s Head of Global ESG, I’m increasingly inspired by the actions of CEOs, board rooms and other key stakeholders to drive positive change. I can also see the challenges facing truly purpose-driven organizations who are unable to demonstrate their societal value and may be accused of ‘tokenism’ or even ‘green washing’. The ‘cherry picking’ of a so-called ‘alphabet soup’ of standards and the confusing landscape of reporting that results is having a huge negative impact on trust, and transformation to more consistent reporting is long overdue.
A climate standard will play a major role in the ISSB’s announcements this week and rightly so, but it’s reassuring to see that the ‘S’ in ESG has also played its part in motivating the organization’s strategy.
I’ve spoken extensively about my own experiences and challenges developing my career as a person of black heritage and from a working-class background. The climate and societal inequality are inextricably linked. An environmental crisis – often driven by the most wealthy nations – simply adds to the challenges facing developing nations, who, themselves often struggle to have their voices heard – slowing progress towards an inclusive and Just Transition to a low carbon economy.
It is now for jurisdictions and regulators to play their part and mandate these standards, which are designed to be globally relevant and achievable. Politicians need to act now, and use these standards to ensure that the global reporting landscape is firmly anchored to this baseline. If this happens, the standards will genuinely impact every single citizen on the planet.
For businesses, it’s a moment to shine. We can become the drivers for change– delivering the most clear narrative on what we’re doing to tackle social change and the climate crisis with tangible evidence. For the first time in our history, investors and stakeholders will be able to pick and choose who they work with, based on consistent and easy-to-understand data that follows the same principles, regardless of territory or sector.
The moment for change has arrived. It’s time for business leaders to embrace the opportunity.

"June 28, 2023","50% of CEOs Have Pay Tied to ESG Goals, up from 15% One Year Ago: IBM Survey","The practice of linking incentive pay for senior executives to performance on ESG factors has surged in the past year, with approximately half of CEOs reporting that their compensation is now tied to sustainability goals, up from only 15% one year ago, according to a new global CEO survey released by IBM.
For the study, “CEO decision-making in the age of AI,” the IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV), in cooperation with Oxford Economics, interviewed 3,000 CEOs across more than 30 countries and 24 industries, with a focus on areas including perspectives on leadership and business, the executives’ changing roles and responsibilities, key challenges and opportunities, and their use of technology, data and metrics.
In addition to the rapidly growing integration of ESG factors into executive compensation, the survey also found that “Environmental sustainability” was identified as the most frequently cited top challenge over the next three years by CEOs, at 42%, and retaining the top spot from last year’s survey, followed by cybersecurity and data privacy at 32% and tech modernization at 27%.
Even as sustainability challenges and incentives remain top of mind, however, the IBM report found that environmental sustainability has declined on the list of top organizational priorities, with respondents ranking it in fifth place, down from third in the prior year, as ‘productivity or profitability’ surge to the top spot (from 6th last year), and cybersecurity and data privacy move higher as well.
The lower prioritization on sustainability comes as progress on sustainability-related initiatives remains slow, with the report citing another recent IBV study, “The ESG data conundrum,” which found that while 95% of companies have now established operational ESG goals, only 10% have made significant progress towards achieving them, with a lack of inadequate data cited as the greatest obstacle.
The earlier study also found that nearly three quarters of executives agreed that ESG needs to be a higher priority for their organizations, but noted challenges to sustainability efforts including inadequate data (the top cited challenge at 41%), followed by regulatory barriers at 39%. The study found that less than half of CEOs (45%) reported confidence in their organizations’ ability to report on ESG strategy and initiatives, and that this lack of confidence was mirrored by consumers, with consumer trust in corporate sustainability statements plummeting over the past few years to only 20% from 48% in 2021.
Similarly, the new report found that only 34% of CEOs often use ESG data to make strategic decisions, compared to 76% and 75% who use operational data and financial data, respectively.
A related challenge towards making progress on sustainability initiatives revealed by the report was a lack of consistent standards, with 56% of CEOs reporting that they are currently delaying at least one major investment due to a lack of consistent standards, particularly in emerging areas such as sustainability and data & privacy.
In the report, IBV wrote:
“Tracking and measurement in the sustainability space is a huge issue, according to the CEOs we interviewed.”
